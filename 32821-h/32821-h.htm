<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<hr />

<p>The author of the following letters is aware that
his publication would have possessed greater utility,
had the architectural descriptions been more minute.
He ventures to hope, however, that this imperfection
may be in some measure balanced by the
more extended sphere opened to whatever information
it may contain.</p>

<p>The absence of many technical expressions, especially
those which enter into a detailed description
of almost all Gothic buildings, and the employment
of which was forbidden by the occasion, may tend
to facilitate the satisfaction of popular curiosity
respecting Spanish art: the more so from the circumstance
that the most intelligent in such subjects
are scarcely sufficiently agreed on the application
of technical terms, to allow of the compilation of a
standard vocabulary. His ambition will be more
than satisfied, should his past, and perhaps future
researches, succeed, in some degree, in pioneering
the path for a more scientific pen.</p>

<p>Should this work fall into the hands of any reader,
whose expectations of entertainment may have
been encouraged by the announcement of another
Spanish tour, but who may feel but moderate enthusiasm
for the artistic and monumental glories
of the Peninsula, an explanation is due to him,
exonerative of the author from much of the responsibility
attached to the matter-of-fact tone of his
descriptions. It is no less his nature than it was
his wish to paint what he saw as he saw it. Unfortunately
his visits to Spain took place after the
accomplishment of the revolution, the hardest blows
of which were aimed at her church. The confiscation
of the ecclesiastical revenues has necessarily
stripped the processions and other ceremonies of
their former splendour, and by suppressing what constituted
one of their chief attractions to the native
population, transferred the interest of the lover of
the picturesque from the bright colours of animated
grouping, to the dead background of stone and
marble they have left.</p>

<p>In studying, however, to preserve this strict accuracy
in all that related to the principal subject of
his correspondence, his aim was to enliven it by
the introduction of any incidents worthy of notice
which came under his observation. In this object
he hopes he may have succeeded.</p>

<p>One more remark is necessary. The letters from
Seville, which form the second of the two parts
into which the volume is divided, although placed
last in order of succession, date in reality from
an earlier period than the rest; and even from
a different tour, as will appear from the description
of the route. They were addressed to various
individuals, whereas those forming the first
part were all written to the same person. They
are thus placed with a view to geographical order
and clearness, and to a sort of unity, which appeared
advisable in the subject of a volume. The
two excursions having been separated by an interval
of three years, should alterations have taken place
during that period in the places described, the above
circumstance not being borne in mind might lead to
an appearance of chronological inaccuracy in the
descriptions, although there is not much probability
of the existence of such changes.</p>

<h5>TO MRS. C&mdash;&mdash; R.</h5>

<p class="r">Rue de Richelieu.<br />
</p>

<p>You perceived at a glance the satisfaction you
caused me, when, on receiving my temporary adieus,
you requested me to send you some account of my
travels in Spain. Had it not been so, you had not
been in possession, on that day, of your usual penetration.
Indeed, you no doubt foresaw it; aware
that, next to the pleasure of acquiring ocular information
respecting the peculiar objects which interest
an individual, there is no greater one than that of
communicating to a spirit, animated by congenial
tastes, the results of his explorations. You must have
foreseen, that, with my recollections of the pleasure
I had derived from our excursions in one of the
most interesting regions of France, during which I
was witness to the intelligence and rapidity of perception<a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a>
you displayed in the appreciation of the monuments
of the Middle Ages, the opportunity of committing
to paper the impressions I should receive in a
country so rich in those treasures, with a view to
your information, would give an additional interest
to my tour, as well as encouragement in surmounting
the obstacles to be met with among a people
not yet broken in to the curiosity of tourists.</p>

<p>You professed also, with a modesty always becoming
to talent and worth, a complete ignorance respecting
Spain: adding, that you would be grateful
for every sort of information; and that you were
anxious to be enlightened on the subject not only
of the monuments and fine arts, but also of the
history of that country, of which you had never had an
opportunity of informing yourself; summing up by
the enumeration of the three names of the Cid,
Charles the Fifth, and Roderic the Goth, the entire
amount of your acquaintance with the leading
characters of Spanish history.</p>

<p>Indeed, the ignorance you profess with some
exaggeration, is more or less general in our country;
nor is it surprising that such should be the
case. Spain has been in modern times in the background
of European progress. The thousand inconveniences
of its routes and inns have deterred
the most enterprising from making it a place of<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a>
resort; and while a hundred less interesting scenes
of travel, such as Baden-Baden, Bohemia, sporting
adventures in Norway, or winterings in St. Petersburg,
have claimed your attention during the reposes
of quadrilles, and substantiated the conversation
of several of your morning visitors, Spain
has been unnoticed and unknown&mdash;laid on the
shelf with the Arabian Nights&mdash;considered a sort of
fabulous country, which it would be charming to
know, but with which there would never be a
chance of forming an acquaintance; and you have
contented yourself with a sort of general information
respecting it, derived from a few romances and
poems. You are intimate with Boabdil and the
wars of Granada, but to those events is limited
your knowledge of its ancient history; and the
reigns of Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second,
with the addition of some confused visions, in which
<i>autos-da-fé</i> and dungeons contrast in a rather
gloomy background with laughing majas, whirling
their castagnettes to the soft cadences of guitars,
fill up the remaining space allotted to Spain in your
recollections.</p>

<p>It would be a task full of interest for me&mdash;possessed,
as I shall probably be, of ample opportunities
for its accomplishment&mdash;to draw up for your information
a summary of the leading events of<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a>
Spanish history; connecting them by the chain of
reigns of the successive sovereigns; and thus to press
into a limited compass a sort of abstract of the
annals of this extraordinary nation: but I am
deterred by the certainty that such an attempt, by
me, would fail of its intended object. The events,
thus slurred over, would have the effect of whetting
the appetite for knowledge, which they would not
satisfy; and the interminable lists of monarchs, of
successions, usurpations, alliances and intermarriages,
rendered doubly intricate by the continual recurrence
of the same names, without sufficient details to
particularise each&mdash;a chaos of outlines without the
necessary shading to bring out the figures from the
canvass&mdash;would not only set at defiance the clearest
memory, but would be a trial which I would not
for worlds impose upon your patience. No history
is more attractive than that of Spain; and those
works which exist upon the subject, although all,
more or less, sullied with inaccuracies, and most of
them infected with prejudice, and immersed in superstitious
delusion, are still well worth your perusal;
but it would lead me out of my depth, were I to
undertake in my correspondence more than an occasional
historical quotation, when required by the
interest attached to any monument which it may
fall to my lot to describe.<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a></p>

<p>Were I not to transmit to you a conscientious and
faithful account of all that I shall see, I should be
guilty of cruelty; and that the more base, from the
certain impunity that must attend it. I say this,
from the impossibility of your ever undertaking the
same journey, and consequently of your ever being
able to compare my portraits with their originals.
In fact, the incompatibility of your nature, and that
of the Spanish climate, must ever be present to me,
who, during the vivifying heats of the late very bearable
<i>canicule</i>, in your French château&mdash;so constructed
as to perform the functions of an atmospheric sieve,
by separating the wind, which rushed through its
doors and windows, judiciously placed in parallels for
the purpose, from the warmer sunshine without&mdash;was
witness, nevertheless, to your unaffected distress,
when you protested against any lofty, oak-panelled
room being sat or reclined in by more than one
human being at a time, lest it should be over-heated;
placing thus an obstacle in the way of conversation,
in which to shine is your especial province, by rendering
it necessary to converse through various open
doors; while, were an additional testimony necessary
to prove the sincerity of your sufferings, your favourite
of favourites, Caliph, repulsed and uncaressed,
hung his silken ears, as he solemnly retreated to coil<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>
himself on a distant rug, and voted the dog-days a
misnomer.</p>

<p>Nor were you contented with your atmosphere,
until, the season of insects and <i>al-fresco</i> suppers being
long left behind, and the autumnal equinox having
peremptorily closed the doors and windows, fitted,
alas! by a carpenter who flourished in the reign of
Louis the Fourteenth, so plentiful a supply of air
was afforded by the handy-works of the said carpenter,
that the Chinese screen had some difficulty
in maintaining its post, and the flames of the well-furnished
elm-fire ascended with a roar that
would have shamed many a cataract of the rival
element. Not but that I would willingly forego
the opportunity of sending you erroneous information,
in exchange for your presence in that
country; and for your assistance in comprehending
the nature of a people apparently composed of such
contradictory ingredients. You might probably succeed
in fathoming the hidden springs of character,
which give birth to a crowd of anomalies difficult to
explain. You would discover by what mystery of
organization a people, subject to the influence of
violent passions, combine an abject subjection to the
forms of etiquette, carried to its extreme in every-day

worthy of the days of Orlando and Rodomonte;<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a>
and account for a nation exchanging a costume
which combines utility with grace, for one inferior
in both respects. Inventors of whatever is
most fascinating in dances and music&mdash;you would
discover the motive which induces them to abandon
both, but principally the first, which they replace
by the French <i>rigodon</i>, or dancing-made-easy, and
adapted to youth, manhood, and all stages of paralysis;
and, possessing the cathedrals of Leon, Burgos,
and Seville, to denounce Gothic architecture as barbarous,
and to brand it with the contemptuous denomination
of "crested masonry."</p>

<p>Should my mono-(&mdash;monument-) mania run riot,
and over-describe, over-taxing even your passion for
that branch of art, be assured&mdash;and to this promise
you may always look back for consolation and encouragement&mdash;that
I will not write you a history of
the recent, or any previous Spanish revolution,
<i>apropos</i> of the first sentry-box I meet with, even
though its form be that of a Lilliputian brick castle.
Nor shall my first glimpse of a matador occasion you
a list of bull-fights, voluminous enough to line the
circumference of the <i>barrera</i>. No Diligence shall be
waylaid, nor in my presence shall any ladies' fingers
be amputated, the quicker to secure her rings, if I
can possibly avoid it; and, as far as depends on me,
I shall arrive in a whole skin at each journey's end,<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a>
and without poisoning you or myself with garlick,
unless the new Cortes pass a law for denying to the
stranger all other sorts of aliment.</p>

<p>I have resolved, by a process of reasoning which I
need not at present impart to you, and in virtue of
a permission which I have little doubt of your granting,
to publish my part of our correspondence. I
think that neither of us will be a loser by this plan,
however conceited I may appear to you for saying so.
Yourself, in the first place, must be a gainer by the
perusal of descriptions, on which, from their being
prepared for the ordeal of a less indulgent eye,
greater care will necessarily be expended: the public
may benefit in obtaining information, which shall
be at all events accurate, relative to subjects as yet
inadequately appreciated by those they are the most
likely to interest: while the chief gainer, in the event
of these two ends being attained, will of course be
your devoted and humble correspondent.<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a></p>

<h5>ROUTE TO SPAIN THROUGH FRANCE.</h5>

<p class="r">Bayonne.<br />
</p>

<p>The position of Burgos on the principal line of
communication by which Madrid is approached from
the north of Europe; the fact of its being the first
city met with, after crossing the Pyrenees, in which
monuments are found remaining of the former genius
and grandeur of the country; and the name of which
calls up the more stirring and eventful epochs of
Spanish history,&mdash;render it, notwithstanding its actual
distance from the frontier, a sort of introduction or
gateway to Spain&mdash;the Spain of the tourist.</p>

<p>The most agreeable and least troublesome way of
visiting the best parts of Spain excludes, it is true,
this route; for the provinces of the Peninsula which
combine the greater number of requisites for the enjoyment
of life with the most attractive specimens of
the picturesque, whether natural or artificial, are
those nearest to the coast, and they are approached
more conveniently by sea. Those, however, who can<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>
devote sufficient time, will be repaid, by a tour in the
interior of the country, for the increase of trouble it
may occasion them; and this tour should precede
the visit to the maritime provinces, as it will render
their superior comforts and climate the more acceptable
from the contrast. The scenery of the Pyrenees,
and the passing acquaintance formed with the
original and picturesque population of the Basque
provinces, secure the traveller against any danger of
ennui throughout the land-journey between the frontier
and the city of Burgos.</p>

<p>There does not exist the same security throughout
the extent of route which it is necessary to travel in
order to reach this frontier. The approach to Spain
across the south-western provinces of France offers
few objects worthy of detaining us on our way to the
Peninsula. It is one of the least interesting of
French routes. From Paris you pass through Orleans
and Tours. At Chatellerault&mdash;between the latter
city and Poitiers&mdash;the inn-door is besieged by women
offering knives for sale. It is everywhere known
that cutlery is not one of the departments of French
manufactures which have attained the greatest degree
of superiority. A glance at the specimens offered
for our choice while changing horses at Chatellerault,
showed them to be very bad, even for
France.<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a></p>

<p>This did not, however, prevent a multitude of
travellers from purchasing each his knife, nor one of
them from laying in a plentiful stock, stating that
he destined a knife for each member of his family&mdash;evidently
one of the most numerous in France. I
inquired of a native the explanation of this scene,
and whether these knives were considered superior
to those met with in other towns. "Oh no," was the
reply; "but it is usual to buy knives here." I ventured
to say I thought them very bad. "That is of
no consequence; because, whenever you have passed
through Chatellerault, every one asks you for a knife
made on the spot." These victims of custom had
paid enormous prices for their acquisitions.</p>

<p>Poitiers is a crazy old town, but contains one of
the most admirable specimens of the architecture immediately
preceding the pointed, or ogivale, and
which the French savans call "the Romane." I allude
to the church called "the Notre Dame de Poitiers."
The west front is highly ornamented, and unites all
the peculiar richness with the quaintness and simplicity
of design which characterize that fine old
style. I must not omit the forest of Chatellerault,
passed through on leaving that town. It is famous
as the scene of the picnic given to the ladies of the
neighbouring city by the officers of a Polish regiment
quartered there, immediately before the breaking out<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>
of the Peninsular war. It is related that Polish
gallantry overstepped etiquette to such a degree,&mdash;and
<i>that</i> by premeditation,&mdash;as to urge these cavaliers,
by force of bayonet, and sentries, to separate all the
husbands, and other male relatives, from the fairer portion
of the guests. The consequences of such a termination
of the festivities may easily be imagined; Bonaparte,
a rigid judge with regard to all divorces except
his own, on receiving the complaint of the insulted
town, condemned the officers <i>en masse</i> to be decimated,
and the survivors degraded from their rank. He
relented, however, afterwards, on an understanding
that they were to regain their sullied laurels in the
Peninsula; where, in fact, in consequence of his
orders, such opportunities were afforded them, that
scarcely a man in the regiment survived the earliest
campaigns.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Chatellerault are said to take
great offence on being asked their age, suspecting the
inquirer of a malicious calculation.</p>

<p>The new quarter of Bordeaux is handsome, spacious,
and airy. In the promenade called "La Quinconce,"
on the bank of the river, a large insulated edifice,
the most monumental in view, is discovered by the
inscription on its front to be an establishment for
warm baths. At one extremity of the principal
façade is seen, in sculptured letters, "Bains des<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>
dames;" at the other, "Bains des hommes." At this
latter entrance a handsome staircase leads to the
corridor of general communication, on the unsullied
white wall of which the code of discipline of the
establishment, traced in large sable characters, forces
itself on the notice of the visitor. It consists of the
following single and rather singular statute: "Il est
expressement défendu aux garçons de permettre à
deux hommes de se servir de la même baignoire."
After some reflection I concluded it to be a measure
of precaution with regard to cleanliness, carried, no
doubt, to an extreme at Bordeaux. This town is
well deserving of a few days' halt, should the traveller's
object be amusement, or the pleasures of the
table, for which it enjoys a well-merited reputation.
It is a large and handsome city, the second in France
in beauty, and vies with the capital in the elegance
of its shops and principal streets. The theatre is,
externally, the finest in France; and there is, besides
the cathedral, and surpassing it in interest and antiquity,
a remarkable Gothic church.</p>

<p>Of the sixty leagues which separate this town from
Bayonne, forty afford the most perfect example of
monotony. One sighs for the Steppes of Russia.
These are the well-known Landes, consisting of uncultivated
sands and morass; now covered league
after league with the unvarying gloom of the pine<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>
and cork forests,&mdash;now dreary and bare,&mdash;but ever
presenting to the wearied eye a wide interminable
waste, replete with melancholy and desolation. It is
true, that a day of pouring rain was not calculated to
set off to advantage the qualities of such a region,
and should in strict justice be admitted in evidence
before passing condemnation on the Landes.<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a></p>

<h3><a name="LETTER_III" id="LETTER_III"></a>LETTER III.</h3>

<h5>THE BASQUE PROVINCES.</h5>

<p class="r">Burgos.<br />
</p>

<p>It never causes me surprise when I see the efforts
made by persons of limited means to obtain the situation
of Consul in a continental town.</p>

<p>In spite of one's being, as it were, tied to one's
residence,&mdash;and that not one's home,&mdash;there are advantages
which counterbalance the evil. The place
carries with it a certain degree of consequence. One
feels oneself suddenly a man of influence, and a
respectable public character. I have heard one, certainly
far from being high on the list of these functionaries,
termed by a humbler inhabitant of his
"residence," the "Premier Consul."</p>

<p>The income, too, is, it is true, limited; but then
one is usually in a cheap place. In fact, I always
envied these favoured individuals. No calling, however,
is without its <i>déboires</i>. It seems as if Providence
had decreed that an income cannot be fairly,<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a>
if agreeably, earned. Thus, the set-off against the
bliss of the consul, is the necessity he is under of
holding out his hand for his fee. I make these remarks,
to introduce to your notice an ingenious
method, put in practice&mdash;probably invented&mdash;by our
consul at Bayonne, for getting over the irksomeness
of this duty. I found him in his <i>bureau</i>, pen in
hand, and a large sheet of official-shaped paper before
him, half written over. On my passport being
presented for his <i>visa</i>, his countenance assumed
a painful expression, in which regret was blended
with a sort of tendency to compassion, and which at
first occasioned me a sensation of alarm, conjuring up
in my imagination all the consequences of an irregular
passport&mdash;tedious routes to be retraced, time
lost, expense incurred, and suspicion, and even incarceration&mdash;infection&mdash;death!</p>

<p>Meanwhile he pointed to the letter he was writing,
and, drawing forward with the other hand a chair,
said that he was at that moment memorializing the
Foreign Office on the subject of these visas; that his
pain was extreme at seeing travellers compelled to
send or come to his office, and to lose thus much
valuable time; he was likewise concerned at their
having to pay three francs each for so useless a ceremony
as his visa; but he wished it to be remarked,
that it was at present a ceremony quite indispensable;<a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a>
since, only four days back, a gentleman had been
compelled to return from the Spanish frontier (a
distance of seven leagues) in the middle of the night,
in consequence of his having neglected this, as yet,
necessary observance.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Leaving Bayonne by Diligence, although still at
some distance from the frontier, you are already in a
Spanish vehicle. The only difference consists in its
being drawn by horses as far as Irun, a few hundred
yards in Spain, at which place they are replaced by
a team of mules; but the <i>mayoral</i> is Spanish from
the commencement, as also usually the greater number
of the travellers. From the first view of
Spanish ground, the monotony of the landscape
ceases, and gives place to picturesque scenery. This
effect is as sudden as if produced by the whistle of
a scene-shifter. From the brow of a hill the valley
of the Bidassoa opens on the view, the bay on the
right, two or three towns in the centre, and beyond
them, stretching to the left, the chain of the
Pyrenees. This opening scene is very satisfactory
to the newly arrived traveller, whose expectations
have been rising towards fever-heat as he gradually
neared the object of his dreams&mdash;the "renowned
romantic land;" the more so, as he is well prepared,<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a>
by the Landes of France, to enjoy to the utmost
the variety of scene afforded by the two days of
mountain and valley which separate the frontier
from the town of Vitoria.</p>

<p>The Diligence comes to a halt every afternoon;
the day's journey having commenced at three in the
morning. There are three of these days between
Bayonne and Burgos. At Tolosa and Vitoria&mdash;the
intermediate places of rest&mdash;the system is as follows:
Arriving at about four in the afternoon, an interval
is allowed of about two hours, which in a long
journey can always be profitably employed, until the
meal, called supper. This is Homerically plentiful,
and varied sufficiently to suit the tastes of
all such as are accustomed to the vicissitudes of
travelling. The repast over, all gradually retire to
their sleeping apartments, where they are undisturbed
until two o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>At this hour each passenger is furnished with a
candle, and requested to get up; and at a quarter to
three the <i>muchacha</i> (chambermaid) reappears, bearing
in her hand a plate, on which, after rubbing his
eyes, the traveller may discover, if it be allowed so
to speak, an imperceptible cup, a <i>xicara</i>,&mdash;since, having
the thing, they have a name for it, which is of
course untranslateable,&mdash;of excellent chocolate, an
<i>azucarillo</i> (almost transparent sugar prepared for<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a>
instantaneous melting), a glass of water, and a piece
of bread. After partaking of this agreeable refreshment,
you have just time left to pay your
bill, fold up your passport, which during the night
has remained in the hands of the police, and to
take your seat in the Diligence.</p>

<p>The towns of the Basque provinces appear not to
have been much maltreated during the Carlist war;
not so the villages, most of which present a melancholy
aspect of ruin and desolation. The churches,
built so as to appear more like keeps of castles,
have mostly withstood the shock. The destruction
was oftener the result of burning than of artillery.
The lover of the picturesque offers his silent gratitude
to the combatants on both sides, for sparing, although
unintentionally, some of the most charming objects
of all Spain.</p>

<p>Among the most striking of these is Hernani.
It is composed of one street, of the exact required
width for the passage of an ordinary vehicle. This
street is a perfect specimen of picturesque originality.
The old façades are mostly emblazoned with the
bearings of their ancient proprietors, sculptured in
high relief. On entering the place, the effect is
that of a deep twilight after the broad blaze of the
sunny mountains. This is caused by the almost
flat roofs, which advance considerably beyond the<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a>
fronts of the houses, and nearly meet in the centre
of the street: the roof of each house is either
higher or lower, or more or less projecting, than
its neighbour; and all are supported by carved
woodwork, black from age. The street terminates
on the brow of a hill, and widens at the end, so
as to form a small square, one retreating side of
which is occupied by the front of a church covered
with old sculpture; and the diligence, preceded
by its long team of tinkling mules, disappears
through the arched gateway of a Gothic castle.</p>

<p>In this part of Spain one does not hear the sounds
of the guitar; these commence further on. On
Sundays and holydays, the fair of Tolosa, and of the
other Basque towns, flourish their castagnettes to
the less romantic whinings of the violin; but, in
traversing the country, the ear is continually met
by a sound less musical, although no less national,
than that of the guitar&mdash;a sort of piercing and loud
complaint, comparable to nothing but the screams
of those who have "relinquished hope" at Dante's
grim gateway.</p>

<p>These unearthly accents assail the ear of the
traveller long before he can perceive the object
whence they proceed; but, becoming louder and
louder, there will issue from a narrow road, or
rather ravine, a diminutive cart, shut in between<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a>
two small round tables for wheels. Their voice
proceeds from their junction with the axle, by a
contrivance, the nature of which I did not examine
closely enough to describe. A French tourist expresses
much disgust at this custom, which he
attributes to the barbarous state of his neighbours,
and their ignorance of mechanical art; it is, however,
much more probable that the explanation
given by the native population is the correct one.
According to this, the wheels are so constructed
for the useful purpose of forewarning all other
drivers of the approach of a cart. The utility of
some such invention is evident. The mountain
roads are cut to a depth often of several yards,
sometimes scores of yards, (being probably dried-up
beds of streams,) and frequently for a distance of
some furlongs admit of the passage of no more than
one of these carts at a time, notwithstanding their
being extremely narrow. The driver, forewarned
at a considerable distance by a sound he cannot
mistake, seeks a wide spot, and there awaits the
meeting.</p>

<p>You need not be told that human experience
analysed resolves itself into a series of disappointments.
I beg you to ask yourself, or any of your
acquaintances, whether any person, thing, or event
ever turned out to be exactly, or nearly, such as<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a>
was expected he, she, or it would be. According
to the disposition of each individual, these component
parts of experience become the bane or
the charm of his life.</p>

<p>This truth may be made, by powerful resolve,
the permanent companion of your reflections, so as
to render the expectation of disappointment stronger
than any other expectation. What then? If you
know the expected result will undergo a metamorphosis
before it becomes experience, you will not be
disappointed. Only try. For instance,&mdash;every one
knows the Spanish character by heart; it is the
burden of all literary productions, which, from the
commencement of time, have treated of that country.
A Carlist officer, therefore,&mdash;the hopeless martyr in
the Apostolic, aristocratic cause of divine right; the
high-souled being, rushing into the daily, deadly
struggle, supported, instead of pay and solid rations,
by his fidelity to his persecuted king;&mdash;such a
character is easily figured. The theory of disappointments
must here be at fault. He is a true
Spaniard; grave, reserved, dignified. His lofty presence
must impress every assembly with a certain
degree of respectful awe.&mdash;I mounted the <i>coupé</i>,
or <i>berlina</i>, of the Diligence, to leave Tolosa, with
a good-looking, fair, well-fed native, with a long
falling auburn moustache. We commenced by bandying<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a>
civilities as to which should hold the door
while the other ascended. No sooner were we
seated than my companion inquired whether I was
military; adding, that he was a Carlist captain of
cavalry returning from a six months' emigration.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the complete polish of his manners
in addressing me, it was evident he enjoyed an
uncommon exuberance of spirits, even more than
the occasion could call for from the most ardent
lover of his country; and I at first concluded he
must have taken the earliest opportunity (it being
four o'clock in the morning) of renewing his long-interrupted
acquaintance with the flask of <i>aguardiente</i>:
but that this was not the case was evident
afterwards, from the duration of his tremendous
happiness. During the first three or four hours,
his tongue gave itself not an instant's repose.
Every incident was a subject of merriment, and,
when tired of talking to me, he would open the
front-window and address the <i>mayoral</i>; then roar
to the postilion, ten mules ahead; then swear
at the <i>zagal</i> running along the road, or toss his
cigar-stump at the head of some wayfaring peasant-girl.</p>

<p>Sometimes, all his vocabulary being exhausted,
he contented himself with a loud laugh, long continued;
then he would suddenly fall asleep, and,<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a>
after bobbing his head for five or six minutes,
awake in a convulsion of laughter, as though his
dream was too merry for sleep. Whatever he said
was invariably preceded by two or three oaths,
and terminated in the same manner. The Spanish
(perhaps, in this respect, the richest European
language) hardly sufficed for his supply. He therefore
selected some of the more picturesque specimens
for more frequent repetition. These, in default
of topics of conversation, sometimes served
instead of a fit of laughter or a nap: and once or
twice he hastily lowered the window, and gave
vent to a string of about twenty oaths at the
highest pitch of his lungs; then shut it deliberately,
and remained silent for a minute. During dinner he
cut a whole cheese into lumps, with which he stuffed
an unlucky lap-dog, heedless of the entreaties of two
fair fellow-travellers, proprietors of the condemned
quadruped. This was a Carlist warrior!</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Basque provinces are
a fine race, and taller than the rest of the Spaniards.
The men possess the hardy and robust appearance
common to mountaineers, and the symmetry of form
which is almost universal in Spain, although the
difference of race is easily perceptible. The women
are decidedly handsome, although they also are anything
but Spanish-looking; and their beauty is<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a>
often enhanced by an erect and dignified air, not
usually belonging to peasants, (for I am only speaking
of the lower orders,) and attributable principally to a
very unpeasant-like planting of the head on the neck
and shoulders. I saw several village girls whom
nothing but their dress would prevent from being
mistaken for German or English ladies of rank,
being moreover universally blondes. On quitting
Vitoria, you leave behind you the mountains and
the pretty faces.</p>

<p>For us, however, the latter were not entirely
lost. There were two in the Diligence, belonging
to the daughters of a Grandee of the first class,
Count de P. These youthful señoritas had taken
the opportunity, rendered particularly well-timed
by the revolutions and disorders of their country,
of passing three years in Paris, which they employed
in completing their education, and seeing
the wonders of that town, <i>soi-disant</i> the most civilized
in the world; which probably it would have been, had
the old <i>régime</i> not been overthrown. They were
now returning to Madrid, furnished with all the
new ideas, and the various useful and useless accomplishments
they had acquired.</p>

<p>Every one whose lot it may have been to undertake
a journey of several days in a Diligence,&mdash;that
is, in one and the same,&mdash;and who consequently recollects<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a>
that trembling and anxious moment during
which he has passed in review the various members
of the society of which he is to be, <i>nolens volens</i>,
a member; and the feverish interest which directed
his glance of rapid scrutiny towards those in particular
of the said members with whom he was to
be exposed to more immediate contact, and at the
mercy of whose birth and education, habits, opinions,
prejudices, qualities, and propensities, his happiness
and comfort were to be placed during so large and
uninterrupted a period of his existence,&mdash;will comprehend
my gratitude to these fair <i>émigrées</i>, whose
lively conversation shortened the length of each
day, adding to the charms of the magnificent
scenery by the opportunity they afforded of a congenial
interchange of impressions. Although we did not
occupy the same compartment of the carriage, their
party requiring the entire interior and <i>rotonde</i>, we
always renewed acquaintance when a prolonged
ascent afforded an opportunity of liberating our
limbs from their confinement.</p>

<p>The two daily repasts also would have offered no
charm, save that of the Basque <i>cuisine</i>,&mdash;which,
although cleanly and solid, is not perfectly <i>cordon bleu</i>,&mdash;but
for the entertaining conversation of my fair fellow-travellers,
who had treasured up in their memory
the best sayings and doings of Arnal, and the other<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a>
Listons and Yateses of the French capital, which,
seasoned with a slight Spanish accent, were indescribably
<i>piquants</i> and original. My regret was
sincere on our respective routes diverging at Burgos;
for they proceeded by the direct line over the
Somo sierra to Madrid, while I take the longer road
by the Guadarramas, in order to visit Valladolid.
I shall not consequently make acquaintance with
the northern approach to Madrid, unless I return
thither a second time; as to that of my fellow-travellers,
I should be too fortunate were it to be
renewed during my short stay in their capital.<a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a></p>

<h3><a name="LETTER_IV" id="LETTER_IV"></a>LETTER IV.</h3>

<h5>ARRIVAL AT BURGOS. CATHEDRAL.</h5>

<p class="r">Burgos.<br />
</p>

<p>The chain of the Lower Pyrenees, after the ascent
from the French side, and a two days' journey of
alternate mountain and valley, terminates on the
Spanish side at almost its highest level. A gentle
descent leads to the plain of Vitoria; and, after leaving
behind the fresh-looking, well-farmed environs of
that town, there remains a rather monotonous day's
journey across the bare plains of Castile, only varied
by the passage through a gorge of about a mile in
extent, called the Pass of Pancorbo, throughout which
the road is flanked on either side by a perpendicular
rock of from six to eight hundred feet elevation.
The ancient capital of Castile is visible from a considerable
distance, when approached in this direction;
being easily recognised by the spires of its cathedral,
and by the citadel placed on an eminence, which
forms a link of a chain of hills crossing the route at
this spot.<a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a></p>

<p>The extent of Burgos bears a very inadequate proportion
to the idea formed of it by strangers, derived
from its former importance and renown. It is composed
of five or six narrow streets, winding round
the back of an irregularly shaped colonnaded plaza.
The whole occupies a narrow space, comprised between
the river Arlançon, and the almost circular
hill of scarcely a mile in circumference, (on which
stands the citadel) and covers altogether about
double the extent of Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>The city has received a sort of modern facing,
consisting of a row of regularly built white houses,
which turn their backs to the Plaza, and front the
river; uniting at one extremity with an ancient gateway,
which, facing the principal bridge, must originally
have stood slightly in advance of the town, to
which it formed a very characteristic entrance. It is
a quadrangular edifice, pierced with a low semicircular
arch. The arch is flanked on the river front
by small circular turrets, and surmounted by seven
niches, containing statues of magistrates, kings, and
heroes; while over these, in a centre niche, stands a
semicolossal statue of the Virgin, from which the
monument derives its title of "Arco de Santa Maria."
Another arch, but totally simple, situated at the
other extremity of the new buildings, faces another
bridge; and this, with that of Santa Maria, and a<a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a>
third, placed halfway between them, leading to the
Plaza, form the three entrances to the city on the
river side.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 527px;">
<a href="images/ill_048_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_048_sml.jpg" width="527" height="550" alt="ARCO DE SANTA MARIA." title="ARCO DE SANTA MARIA." /></a>
<span class="caption">ARCO DE SANTA MARIA.</span>
</div>

<p>The dimensions of this, and many other Spanish
towns, must not be adopted as a base for estimating
their amount of population. Irun, at the frontier
of France, stands on a little hill, the surface of which
would scarcely suffice for a country-house, with its<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a>
surrounding offices and gardens: it contains, nevertheless,
four or five thousand inhabitants, and comprises
a good-sized market-place and handsome town-hall,
besides several streets. Nor does this close
packing render the Spanish towns less healthy than
our straggling cities, planned with a view to circulation
and purity of atmosphere, although the difference
of climate would seem to recommend to each of
the two countries the system pursued by the other.
The humidity of the atmosphere in England would
be the principal obstacle to cleanliness and salubrity,
had the towns a more compact mode of construction;
whilst in Spain, on the contrary, this system is advantageous
as a protection against the excessive
power of the summer sun, which would render our
wide streets&mdash;bordered by houses too low to afford
complete shade&mdash;not only almost impassable, but
uninhabitable.</p>

<p>The Plaza of Burgos (entitled "de la Constitucion,"
or "de Isabel II.," or "del Duque de la Victoria,"
or otherwise, according to the government of
the day,) has always been the resort of commerce.
The projecting first-floors being supported by square
pillars, a sort of bazaar is formed under them, which
includes all the shop population of the city, and
forms an agreeable lounge during wet or too sunny
weather. Throughout the remainder of the town,<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a>
with the exception of the modern row of buildings
above mentioned, almost all the houses are entered
through Gothic doorways, surmounted by armorial
bearings sculptured in stone, which, together with
their ornamental inner courts and staircases, testify
to their having sheltered the chivalry of Old Castile.
The Cathedral, although by no means large, appears
to fill half the town; and considering that, in addition
to its conspicuous and inviting aspect, it is the
principal remaining monument of the ancient wealth
and grandeur of the province, and one of the most
beautiful edifices in Europe, I will lose no time in
giving you a description of it.</p>

<p>This edifice, or at least the greater portion of it,
dates from the thirteenth century. The first stone
was laid by Saint Ferdinand, on the 20th of July
1221. Ferdinand had just been proclaimed king by
his mother Doña Berenguela, who had invested him
with his sword at the royal convent of the Huelgas,
about a mile distant from Burgos. Don Mauricio,
Bishop of Burgos, blessed the armour as the youthful
king girded it, and, three days subsequently to the
ceremony, he united him to the Princess Beatrice, in
the church of the same convent. This bishop assisted
in laying the first stone of the cathedral, and presided
over the construction of the entire body of the
building, including half of the two principal towers.<a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a></p>

<p>His tomb may be seen at the back of the Choir.
From the date of the building its style may at once
be recognised, allowing for a difference which existed
between England and the Continent, the latter being
somewhat in advance. The original edifice must have<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a>
been a very perfect and admirable specimen of the
pointed architecture of its time in all its purity. As
it is, unfortunately, (as the antiquary would say, and,
I should add, the mere man of taste, were it not that
tastes are various, and that the proverb says they
are all in nature,) the centre of the building, forming
the intersection of the transept and nave, owing
to some defect in the original construction, fell
in just at the period during which regular architecture
began to waver, and the style called in France
the "Renaissance" was making its appearance.
An architect of talent, Felipe de Borgoña, hurried
from Toledo, where he was employed in carving
the stalls of the choir, to furnish a plan for the
centre tower. He, however, only carried the work
to half the height of the four cylindrical piers which
support it. He was followed by several others before
the termination of the work; and Juan de Herrera,
the architect of the Escorial, is said to have completed
it. In this design are displayed infinite talent
and imagination; but the artist could not alter the
taste of the age. It is more than probable that he
would have kept to the pure style of his model, but
for the prevailing fashion of his time. Taken by itself,
the tower is, both externally and internally, admirable,
from the elegance of its form, and the richness of
its details; but it jars with the rest of the building.<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a></p>

<p>Placing this tower in the background, we will
now repair to the west front. Here nothing is required
to be added, or taken away, to afford the eye
a feast as perfect as grace, symmetry, grandeur, and
lightness, all combined, are capable of producing.
Nothing can exceed the beauty of this front taken
as a whole. You have probably seen an excellent
view of it in one of Roberts's annuals. The artists
of Burgos complain of an alteration, made some fifty
years back by the local ecclesiastical authorities, nobody
knows for what reason. They caused a magnificent
portal to be removed, to make way for a very
simple one, totally destitute of the usual sculptured
depth of arch within arch, and of the profusion of
statuary, which are said to have adorned the original
entrance. This, however, has not produced a bad
result in the view of the whole front. Commencing
by solidity and simplicity at its base, the pile only
becomes ornamental at the first story, where rows of
small trefoil arches are carved round the buttresses;
while in the intermediate spaces are an oriel window
in an ornamental arch, and two narrow double arches.
The third compartment, where the towers first rise
above the body of the church, offers a still richer
display of ornament. The two towers are here connected
by a screen, which masks the roof, raising the
apparent body of the façade an additional story.<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a>
This screen is very beautiful, being composed of two
ogival windows in the richest style, with eight statues
occupying the intervals of their lower mullions. A
fourth story, equally rich, terminates the towers, on
the summits of which are placed the two spires.</p>

<p>These are all that can be wished for the completion
of such a whole. They are, I imagine, not
only unmatched, but unapproached by any others, in
symmetry, lightness, and beauty of design. The
spire of Strasburg is the only one I am acquainted
with that may be allowed to enter into the comparison.
It is much larger, placed at nearly double
the elevation, and looks as light as one of these; but
the symmetry of its outline is defective, being uneven,
and producing the effect of steps. And then
it is alone, and the absence of a companion gives the
façade an unfinished appearance. For these reasons
I prefer the spires of Burgos. Their form is hexagonal;
they are entirely hollow, and unsupported internally.
The six sides are carved <i>à jour</i>, the design
forming nine horizontal divisions, each division presenting
a different ornament on each of its six sides.
At the termination of these divisions, each pyramid
is surrounded near the summit by a projecting gallery
with balustrades. These appear to bind and keep
together each airy fabric, which, everywhere transparent,
looks as though it required some such restraint,<a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a>
to prevent its being instantaneously scattered
by the winds.</p>

<p>On examining the interior of one of these spires,
it is a subject of surprise that they could have been
so constructed as to be durable. Instead of walls,
you are surrounded by a succession of little balustrades,
one over the other, converging towards the
summit. The space enclosed is exposed to all the
winds, and the thickness of the stones so slight as
to have required their being bound together with
iron cramps. At a distance of a mile these spires
appear as transparent as nets.</p>

<p>On entering the church by the western doors, the
view is interrupted, as is usual in Spain, by a screen,
which, crossing the principal nave at the third or
fourth pillar, forms the western limit of the choir;
the eastern boundary being the west side of the transept,
where there is an iron railing. The space between
the opposite side of the transept and the apse
is the <i>capilla mayor</i> (chief chapel), in which is placed
the high altar. There are two lower lateral naves,
from east to west, and beyond them a series of
chapels. The transept has no lateral naves. Some
of the chapels are richly ornamented. The first or
westernmost, on the north side, in particular, would
be in itself a magnificent church. It is called the
"Chapel of Santa Tecla." Its dimensions are ninety-six
<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a>feet in length, by sixty-three in width, and sixty
high. The ceiling, and different altars, are covered
with a dazzling profusion of gilded sculpture. The
ceiling, in particular, is entirely hidden beneath the
innumerable figures and ornaments of every sort of
form, although of questionable taste, which the ravings
of the extravagant style, called in Spain "Churriguesco"
(after the architect who brought it into
fashion), could invent.</p>

<p>The next chapel&mdash;that of Santa Ana&mdash;is not so
large, but designed in far better taste. It is Gothic,
and dates from the fifteenth century. Here are some
beautiful tombs, particularly that of the founder of
the chapel. But the most attractive object is a picture,
placed at an elevation which renders difficult
the appreciation of its merits without the aid of a
glass,&mdash;a Holy Family, by Andrea del Sarto. It is an
admirable picture; possessing all the grace and simplicity,
combined with the fineness of execution, of
that artist. The chapel immediately opposite (on
the south side) contains some handsome tombs, and
another picture, representing the Virgin, attributed
by the cicerone of the place to Michael Angelo. We
next arrive at the newer part, or centre of the building,
where four cylindrical piers of about twelve feet
diameter, with octagonal bases, form a quadrangle,
and support the centre tower, designed by Felipe<a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a>
de Borgoña. These pillars are connected with each
other by magnificent wrought brass railings, which
give entrance respectively, westward to the choir,&mdash;on
the east to the sanctuary, or capilla mayor,&mdash;and north
and south to the two ends of the transept. Above is
seen the interior of the tower, covered with a profusion
of ornament, but discordant with every other
object within view.</p>

<span class="caption">TRANSEPT OF THE CATHEDRAL, BURGOS.</span>
</div>

<p>The high altar at the back of the great chapel is
also the work of Herrera. It is composed of a series
of rows of saints and apostles, superposed one over
the other, until they reach the roof. All are placed
in niches adorned with gilding, of which only partial
traces remain. The material of the whole is wood.
Returning to either side-nave, a few smaller chapels
on the outside, and opposite them the railings of the
sanctuary, conduct us to the back of the high altar,
opposite which is the eastern chapel, called "of the
Duke de Frias," or "Capilla del Condestable."</p>



<p>All this part of the edifice&mdash;I mean, from the transept
eastward&mdash;is admirable, both with regard to
detail and to general effect. The pillars are carved
all round into niches, containing statues or groups;
and the intervals between the six last, turning round
the apse, are occupied by excellent designs, sculptured
in a hard white stone. The subjects are, the Agony
in the Garden, Jesus bearing the Cross, the Crucifixion,<a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a>
the Resurrection, and the Ascension. The
centre piece, representing the Crucifixion, is the most
striking. The upper part contains the three sufferers
in front; and in the background a variety of buildings,
trees, and other smaller objects, supposed to be
at a great distance. In the foreground of the lower
part are seen the officers and soldiers employed in
the execution; a group of females, with St. John
supporting the Virgin, and a few spectators. The
costumes, the expression, the symmetry of the figures,<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a>
all contribute to the excellence of this piece of sculpture.
It would be difficult to surpass the exquisite
grace displayed in the attitudes, and flow of the
drapery, of the female group; and the Herculean
limbs of the right-hand robber, as he writhes in his
torments, and seems ready to snap the cords which
retain his feet and arms,&mdash;the figure projecting in its
entire contour from the surface of the background,&mdash;present
an admirable model of corporeal expression
and anatomical detail.</p>

<span class="caption">SCULPTURE IN THE APSE.</span>
</div>

<p>In clearing the space to make room for these
sculptures, the artist had to remove the tomb of a
bishop, whose career, if the ancient <i>chronique</i> is to
be depended on, must have been rather singular.
The information, it must be owned, bears the appearance
of having been transmitted by some contemporary
annalist, whose impartiality may have perhaps
been biassed by some of the numerous incitements
which operate upon courtiers.</p>

<p>Don Pedro Fernandez de Frias, Cardinal of Spain,
Bishop of Osma and Cuenca, was, it is affirmed, of
low parentage, of base and licentious habits of life,
and of a covetous and niggardly disposition. These
defects, however, by no means diminished the high
favour he enjoyed at the successive courts of Henry
the Third and Juan the Second. The Bishop of
Segovia, Don Juan de Tordesillas, happened by an<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a>
unlucky coincidence to visit Burgos during his residence
there. The characters of the two prelates
were not of a nature to harmonise in the smallest
degree, and, being thrown necessarily much in each
other's way, they gave loose occasionally to expressions
more than bordering on the irreverent. It was
on one of these occasions, that, the eloquence of the
Cardinal Bishop here interred being at default, a
lacquey of his followers came to his assistance, and
being provided with a <i>palo</i>, or staff, inflicted on the
rival dignitary certain arguments <i>ad humeros</i>&mdash;in fact,
gave the Bishop of Segovia a severe drubbing. The
Cardinal was on this occasion compelled to retire to
Italy.</p>

<p>Turning our backs to the centre piece of sculpture
last described, we enter the Capilla del Condestable
through a superb bronze railing. In these
railings the Cathedral of Burgos rivals that of
Seville, compensating by number for the superior
size and height of those contained in the latter
church. That of the chapel we are now entering
entirely fills the entrance arch, a height of about
forty feet; the helmet of a mounted knight in full
armour, intended to represent St. Andrew, which
crowns its summit, nearly touching the keystone
of the arch. This chapel must be noticed in detail.
Occupying at the extremity of the church a position<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a>
answering to that of Henry the Seventh's Chapel
at Westminster Abbey, it forms a tower of itself,
which on the outside harmonises with peculiar felicity
with the three others, and contributes to the apparent
grandeur and real beauty of the exterior
view. The interior is magnificent, although its plan
and style, being entirely different from those of
Henry the Seventh's Chapel, prevent the comparison
from going further. Its form is octagonal, measuring
about fifty feet in diameter, by rather more than
a hundred in height. Its style florid Gothic of the
fourteenth century. The effect of its first view is
enhanced by its being filled, unlike the rest of the
church, with a blaze of light introduced through
two rows of windows in the upper part.</p>

<p>Two of the sides are furnished with recesses,
which form lesser chapels, and in one of which
there is a fine organ. Between the centre of the
pavement and the principal altar, a large square
block of mixed marble covers the remains of the
founders of the chapel, and bears on its surface their
recumbent figures executed in great perfection.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a>
This is the finest tomb in the cathedral. The embroidery
of the cushions, the ornaments on the
count's armour, the gloves of the countess, are
among the details which merit particular notice
amidst the beautiful execution of the whole. The
high altar of this chapel does not accord with the
general effect, being designed in the style of the
<i>renascimiento</i>. In the centre of it is nevertheless
fixed a treasure that would compensate for worse
defects. A small circular medallion represents the
Virgin and Child, in an attitude very similar to
that of the Madonna della Seggiola, executed on porphyry.
This delicious little work, of about nine
inches in diameter, forms the centre of attraction,
and is the most precious ornament of the chapel.
On the right hand, near the altar, a small doorway
admits to the sacristy.</p>

<p>This contains several relics of the founders. A
small portable altar of ivory, forming the base of a
crucifix of about eighteen inches in height, is an
exquisite model of delicate workmanship. Here<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a>
also has been treasured up a picture, behind a glass,
and in a sort of wooden case; a bequest likewise
of the founders. Unfortunately they neglected to
impart the name of its author. The nebulous sort
of uncertainty thus made to surround this relic
has magnified its merits, which might otherwise perhaps
not have claimed particular notice, to the most
colossal dimensions. They scarcely at last know
what to say of it. At the period of my first visit
to Burgos, it was a Leonardo da Vinci; but, after
a lapse of two years, the same sacristan informed
me that it was uncertain whether the painting
was executed by Raffaelle or Leonardo, although
it was generally supposed to be by Raffaelle; and a
notice, published since, gives the authority of an
anonymous connaisseur, who asserts it to be far superior
to Raffaelle's "Perle." It is now consequently
decided that it cannot be a Leonardo, and is scarcely
bad enough for a Raffaelle.</p>

<p>Without venturing <i>tantas componere lites</i>, I may
be allowed to give my impression, on an inspection as
complete as the studied darkness of the apartment,
added to the glass and wooden case, would permit.
It is a half-figure of the Magdalene. The execution
is very elaborate and highly finished, but
there are evident defects in the drawing. In
colouring and manner it certainly reminds you of<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a>
da Vinci&mdash;of one of whose works it may probably
be a copy; but, whatever it is, it is easy to discover
that it is <i>not</i> a Raffaelle.</p>

<p>This chapel does not occupy the precise centre
of the apse. A line drawn from the middle of
the western door through the nave would divide it
into two unequal parts, passing at a distance of
nearly two yards from its centre. An examination
of the ground externally gives no clue to the cause
of this irregularity, by which the external symmetry
of the edifice is rendered imperfect, although in
an almost imperceptible degree; it must therefore
be accounted for by the situation of the adjoining
parochial chapel, of more ancient construction, with
which it was not allowable to interfere, and by the
unwillingness of the founder to diminish the scale
on which his chapel was planned.</p>

<p>Before we leave the Chapel del Condestable, one
of its ceremonies deserves particular mention. I
allude to the <i>missa de los carneros</i> (sheep-mass).
At early mass on All Souls day, a feast celebrated
in this chapel with extraordinary pomp, six sheep
are introduced, and made to stand on a large block
of unpolished marble, which has been left lying
close to the tombs, almost in the centre of the
chapel; near the six sheep are placed as many
inflated skins of pigs, resembling those usually filled<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a>
with the wine of the country; to these is added
the quantity of bread produced from four bushels
of wheat: and all remain in view during the
performance of high mass. At the conclusion of
the final response, the sheep are removed from their
pedestal, and make for the chapel-gates, through
which they issue; and urged by the voice of their
driver, the peculiar shrill whistle of Spanish shepherds,
and by the more material argument of the
staff, proceed down the entire length of the cathedral
to the music of the aforesaid whistle, accompanied
by their own bleatings and bells, until they vanish
through the great western portal.</p>

<p>Returning to the transepts, we find two objects
worthy of notice. The cathedral having been erected
on uneven ground, rising rapidly from south to
north, the entrance to the north transept opens
at an elevation of nearly thirty feet from the pavement.
To reach this door there is an ornamental
staircase, of a sort of white stone, richly carved in
the <i>renaissance</i> style. This door is never open, a circumstance
which causes no inconvenience; the steps
being so steep as to render them less useful than
ornamental, as long as any other exit exists.</p>

<p>A beautifully carved old door, of a wood become
perfectly black, although not so originally, gives
access to the cloister from the east side of the<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a>
south transept. The interior of the arch which surmounts
it is filled with sculpture. A plain moulding
runs round the top, at the left-hand commencement
of which is carved a head of the natural size,
clothed in a cowl.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 337px;">
<a href="images/ill_068_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_068_sml.jpg" width="337" height="550" alt="HEAD OF SAINT FRANCIS." title="HEAD OF SAINT FRANCIS." /></a>
<span class="caption">HEAD OF SAINT FRANCIS.</span>
</div><p><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The attention is instantly rivetted by this head:
it is not merely a masterpiece of execution. Added
to the exquisite beauty and delicate moulding of
the upper part of the face, the artist has succeeded<a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a>
in giving to the mouth an almost superhuman expression.
This feature, in spite of a profusion of
hair which almost covers it, lives and speaks. A
smile, in which a barely perceptible but irresistible
and, as it were, innate bitterness of satire and disdain
modifies a wish of benevolence, unites with
the piercing expression of the eyes in lighting up
the stone with a degree of intellect which I had
thought beyond the reach of sculpture until I saw
this head. Tradition asserts it to be a portrait of
Saint Francis, who was at Burgos at the period of
the completion of the cathedral; and who, being
in the habit of examining the progress of the works,
afforded unconsciously a study to the sculptor.</p>

<p>The two sacristies are entered from the cloister:
one of them contains the portraits of all the bishops
and archbishops of Burgos. Communicating with
this last is a room destined for the reception of
useless lumber and broken ornaments. Here the
cicerone directs your attention to an old half-rotten
oaken chest, fixed against the wall at a considerable
height. This relic is the famous Coffre del Cid, the
self-same piece of furniture immortalised in the
anecdote related of the hero respecting the loan of
money obtained on security of the supposed treasure
it enclosed. The lender of the money, satisfied by
the weight of the trunk, and the chivalrous honour<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a>
of its proprietor, never saw its contents until shown
them by the latter on the repayment of the loan:
they were then discovered to consist of stones and
fragments of old iron.</p>

<p>One is disappointed on finding in this cathedral
no more durable <i>souvenir</i> of the Cid than his rat-corroded
wardrobe. His remains are preserved in the
chapel of the Ayuntamiento; thither we will consequently
bend our steps, not forgetting to enjoy, as we
leave the church, a long gaze at its elegant and symmetrical
proportions. It may be called an unique model
of beauty of its particular sort, especially when contemplated
without being drawn into comparison with
other edifices of a different class. Catalani is said,
on hearing Sontag's performance, to have remarked
that she was "la première de son genre, mais que
son genre n'était pas le premier." Could the cathedral
of Seville see that of Burgos, it would probably
pronounce a similar judgment on its smaller rival.</p>

<p>The profusion of ornament, the perfection of
symmetry, the completeness of finish, produce an instantaneous
impression that nothing is wanting in this
charming edifice; but any one who should happen to
have previously seen that of Seville cannot, after the
first moments of enthusiasm, escape the comparison
which forces itself on him, and which is not in
favour of this cathedral. It is elegant, but deficient<a name="page_051" id="page_051"></a>
in grandeur; beautiful, but wanting in majesty. The
stern and grand simplicity of the one, thrown into
the scales against the light, airy, and diminutive,
though graceful beauty of the other, recalls the contrast
drawn by Milton between our first parents;
a contrast which, applied to these churches, must
be considered favourable to the more majestic, however
the balance of preference may turn in the
poem.<a name="page_052" id="page_052"></a></p>

<h3><a name="LETTER_V" id="LETTER_V"></a>LETTER V.</h3>

<h5>TOMB OF THE CID. CITADEL.</h5>

<p class="r">Burgos.<br />
</p>

<p>The Ayuntamiento, or Town-hall, presents one
façade to the river, and the other to the Plaza
Mayor, being built over the archway which forms
the already mentioned entrance to the central portion
of the city. The building, like other town-halls,
possesses an airy staircase, a large public room,
and a few other apartments, used for the various
details of administration; but nothing remarkable
until you arrive at a handsomely ornamented saloon,
furnished with a canopied seat fronting a row of arm-chairs.
This is the room in which the municipal
body hold their juntas. It contains several portraits:
two or three of kings, suspended opposite to an equal
number of queens; the two likenesses of the celebrated
judges Nuño Rasura and Lain Calvo, near
which are seen the simple square oaken chairs from
within the angular and hard embrace of which they
administered the laws and government of Castile;<a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a>
a full-length of Fernan Gonzalez; and lastly, one
of the Cid.</p>

<p>Owing to the singularity of this last portrait, it
is the first to attract attention. The hero is represented
in the most extraordinary of attitudes: the
head is thrown back, and the face turned towards
one side; the legs in a sort of studied posture; a
drawn sword is in the right hand, the point somewhat
raised. The general expression is that of a
comic actor attempting an attitude of mock-heroic
impertinence; and is probably the result of an unattained
object in the mind of the artist, of producing
that of fearless independence.</p>

<p>Beyond this apartment is the Chapel, a plain, not
large room, containing but two objects besides its
very simple altar, with its, almost black, silver
candlesticks. Over the altar is a Conception, by
Murillo; and, in the centre of the chapel, a highly
polished and neatly ornamented funereal urn, composed
of walnut-wood, contains the remains of the
Cid: the urn stands on a pedestal. On its two ends
in letters of gold, are inscriptions, stating its contents,
and the date of its application to its present
purpose. I was told that the bones were contained
in a leaden box, but that a glass one was being prepared,
which, on opening the lid of the urn, would
afford a view of the actual dust of the warrior.<a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a></p>

<p>The remains of the Cid have only recently been
conveyed to Burgos from the monastery of San Pedro
de Cardenas, about four miles distant. They had
been preserved there ever since his funeral, which
took place in the presence of King Alonzo the Sixth,
and the two Kings, sons-in-law of the hero, as soon
as the body arrived from Valencia.</p>

<p>This monastic retreat, if dependence may be placed
on the testimony of the Cerberus of the Alcalde,&mdash;the
cicerone (when duly propitiated) of the municipal
edifice,&mdash;did not turn out to be altogether a
place of repose to the warrior. According to this
worthy, an amusing interpreter of the popular local
traditions, the exploits performed subsequently to
the hero's interment were such as almost to throw
a shadow over those he enacted during his mortal
existence. One specimen will suffice. Some twenty
thousand individuals, including the monks of all
the neighbouring monasteries, were assembled in the
church of San Pedro, and were listening to a sermon
on the occasion of the annual festival in honour of
the patron saint. Guided by curiosity, a Moor entered
the church and mingled with the crowd. After
remaining during a short time motionless, he approached
a pillar, against which was suspended a portrait
of the Cid, for the purpose of examining the
picture. Suddenly the figure was seen by all present,<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a>
whose testimony subsequently established the
fact, to grasp with the right hand the hilt of its
sword, and to uncover a few inches of the naked
blade. The Moor instantly fell flat on the pavement,
and was found to be lifeless.</p>

<p>You would be surprised at the difficulty of forming
even here, in the midst of the scenes of his
exploits, a definite idea of this Hercules of the Middle
Ages. For those who are satisfied with the orthodox
histories of the monks, he is without defects&mdash;a
simple unsophisticated demi-god. But there have
been Mahometan historians of Spain. These are
universally acknowledged to have treated of all that
concerned themselves with complete accuracy and
impartiality; and, when this happens, it should seem
to be the best criterion, in the absence of other proof,
of their faithful delineation of others' portraits.</p>

<p>However that may be, here is an instance which
will give you an idea of the various readings of the
Cid's history.</p>

<p>Mariana relates, that an Arab expedition, headed
by five kings (as he terms them) of the adjoining
states, being signalized as having passed the mountains
of Oca, and being occupied in committing depredations
on the Christian territory, Rodrigo suddenly
took the field, recovered all the booty, and
made all five kings prisoners. All this being done<a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a>
by himself and his own retainers. The kings he
released after signing a treaty, according to which
they agreed to pay him an annual tribute. It happened,
that on the occasion of the first payment of
this, Rodrigo was at Zamora, whither he had accompanied
the King of Castile; and he took an opportunity
of receiving the Arab messengers in presence
of the court. This was at least uncommon. The
messengers addressed him by the appellation of Syd
(sir) as they handed over the money. Ferdinand,
delighted with the prowess of his courtier, expressed
on this occasion the desire that he should retain the
title of Syd.</p>

<p>This anecdote undergoes, in the hands of the Arab
writers, a curious metamorphosis. According to them,
the expression Syd was employed, not by tributary
kings, but by certain chiefs of that creed whose pay
the Catholic hero was receiving in return for aid lent
against the Christians of Aragon.</p>

<p>They attribute, moreover, to this mirror of chivalry,
on the surrender of Valencia, a conduct by no
means heroic&mdash;not to say worthy a highwayman.
He accepted, as they relate, the pay of the Emyr of
Valencia to protect the city against the Almoravides,
who at that period were extending their conquests
all over Moorish Spain. The Cid was repulsed, and
the town taken. After this defeat he shut himself<a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a>
up in a castle, since called the Peña del Cid (Rock
of the Cid), and there waited his opportunity. On
the departure of the conquerors from the city, in
which they left an insufficient garrison, he hastened
down at the head of his campeadores, and speedily
retook Valencia.</p>

<p>The Cadi, Ahmed ben Djahhaf, left in command
of the place, had, however, only surrendered on
faith of a capitulation couched in the most favourable
terms. It was even stipulated that he should
retain his post of governor; but no sooner was the
Cid master of the place than he caused the old man
to be arrested and put to the torture, in order to
discover from him the situation of a treasure
supposed to be concealed in the Alcazar; after
which, finding he would not speak, or had nothing
to reveal, he had him burned on the public place.</p>

<p>The Citadel of Burgos, at present an insignificant
fortress, was formerly a place of considerable importance,
and commanded the surrounding country; especially
on the side on which the town&mdash;placed at
the foot of the eminence&mdash;lay beneath its immediate
protection, and could listen unscathed to the whizzing
of the deadly missiles of war as they passed
over its roofs. During the various wars of which
Castile has been the theatre at different periods, this
citadel has, from its important position, occupied the<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a>
main attention of contending armies; and, from forming
a constant <i>point-de-mire</i> to attacking troops, has
finally been almost annihilated. The principal portion
of the present buildings is of a modern date,
but, although garrisoned, the fortress cannot be said
to be restored.</p>

<p>The extent of the town was greater than at present,
and included a portion of the declivity which
exists between the present houses and the walls of
the fortress. At the two extremities of the town-side
of the hill, immediately above the level of the
highest-placed houses now existing, two Arab gate-ways
give access through the ancient town-walls,
which ascended the hill from the bottom. Between
these there exists a sort of flat natural terrace, above
the town, and running along its whole length, on to
which some of the streets open. On this narrow
level stood formerly a part, probably the best part,
of the city, which has shared the fate of its protecting
fortress; but, not being rebuilt, it is now an
empty space,&mdash;or would be so, but for the recent
erection of a cemetery, placed at about half the distance
between the two extremities.</p>

<p>Before, however, the lapse of years had worn away
the last surviving recollections of these localities,
some worshipper of by-gone glory succeeded in discovering,
on the now grass-grown space, the situations<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a>
once occupied by the respective abodes of the
Cid and of Fernan Gonzalez. On these spots monuments
have been erected. That of Gonzalez is a
handsome arch, the piers supporting which are each
faced with two pillars of the Doric order on either
side; above the cornice there is a balustrade, over
which four small obelisks correspond with the respective
pillars. The arch is surmounted by a sort of
pedestal, on which is carved an inscription, stating
the object of the monument. There is nothing on
the top of the pedestal, which appears to have been
intended for the reception of a statue.</p>

<p>The monument in memory of the Cid is more
simple. It consists of three small pyramids in a row,
supported on low bases or pedestals; that in the
centre higher than the other two, but not exceeding
(inclusive of the base) twenty feet from the ground.
On the lower part of the centre stone is carved an
appropriate inscription, abounding in ellipsis, after
the manner usually adopted in Spain.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that these monuments, together
with the memory of the events brought about by the
men in whose honour they have been erected, should
be fast hastening to a level with the desolation immediately
surrounding them. The present political
circumstances of Spain are not calculated to favour
the retrospection of by-gone glories. Scarcely is time<a name="page_060" id="page_060"></a>
allowed&mdash;so rapidly are executed the transmutations
of the modern political diorama&mdash;for examining the
events, or even for recovery from the shock, of
each succeeding revolution; nor force remaining to
the exhausted organs of admiration or of horror, to be
exercised on almost forgotten acts, since those performed
before the eyes of the living generation
have equalled or surpassed them in violence and
energy. The arch of Fernan Gonzalez, if not
speedily restored, (which is not to be expected,)
runs the risk, from its elevation and want of solidity,
of being the first of the two monuments to crumble
to dust; a circumstance which, although not destitute
of an appearance of justice,&mdash;from the fact of
the hero it records having figured on an earlier
page of Castilian annals,&mdash;would nevertheless occasion
regret to those who prefer history to romance, and
who estimate essential services rendered to the
state, as superior to mere individual <i>éclat</i>, however
brilliant.</p>

<p>You will not probably object to the remainder
of this letter being monopolized by this founder
of the independence of Castile; the less so, from
the circumstance of the near connection existing
between his parentage and that of the city we are
visiting, and which owes to him so much of its
celebrity. Should you not be in a humour to be<a name="page_061" id="page_061"></a>
lectured on history, you are at all events forewarned,
and may wait for the next despatch.</p>

<p>Unlike many of the principal towns of the Peninsula,
which content themselves with no more modern
descent than from Nebuchadnezzar or Hercules,
Burgos modestly accepts a paternity within the
domain of probability. A German, Nuño Belchides,
married, in the reign of Alonzo the Great, King of
Oviedo, a daughter of the second Count of Castile,
Don Diego Porcellos. This noble prevailed on his
father-in-law to assemble the inhabitants of the
numerous villages dispersed over the central part
of the province, and to found a city, to which he
gave the German name of "city" with a Spanish
termination. It was Don Fruela III., King of Leon,
whose acts of injustice and cruelty caused so violent
an exasperation, that the nobles of Castile, of whom
there existed several of a rank little inferior to that
of the titular Count of the province, threw up their
allegiance, and selected two of their own body, Nuño
Rasura and Lain Calvo, to whom they intrusted
the supreme authority, investing them with the
modest title of Judges, by way of a check, lest at
any future time they should be tempted, upon the
strength of a higher distinction, to make encroachments
on the common liberties.</p>

<p>The first of the two judges, Nuño Rasura, was the<a name="page_062" id="page_062"></a>
son of the above-mentioned Nuño Belchides and
his wife, Sulla Bella (daughter of Diego Porcellos),
and grandfather of Fernan Gonzalez. His son Gonzalo
Nuño, Fernan's father, succeeded on his death
to the dignity of Judge of Castile, and became
extremely popular, owing to his affability, and winning
urbanity of deportment in his public character.
He established an academy in his palace for
the education of the sons of the nobles, who were
instructed under his own superintendence in all
the accomplishments which could render them distinguished
in peace or in war. The maternal
grandfather of Fernan Gonzalez was Nuño Fernandez,
one of the Counts of Castile who were treacherously
seized and put to death by Don Ordoño,
King of Leon. The young Count of Castile is described
as having been a model of elegance. To
singular personal beauty he added an unmatched
proficiency in all the exercises then in vogue, principally
in arms and equitation. These accomplishments,
being added to much affability and good-nature,
won him the affections of the young nobles,
who strove to imitate his perfections, while they
enjoyed the festivities of his palace.</p>

<p>It appears that, notwithstanding the rebellion, and
appointment of Judges, Castile had subsequently
professed allegiance to the Kings of Leon; for a<a name="page_063" id="page_063"></a>
second revolt was organized in the reign of Don
Ramiro, at the head of which we find Fernan Gonzalez.
On this occasion, feeling themselves too
feeble to resist the royal troops, the rebels had
recourse to a Moorish chief, Aecipha. The King,
however, speedily drove the Moors across the frontier,
and succeeded in capturing the principal revolters.
After a short period these were released, on the sole
condition of taking the oath of allegiance; and
the peace was subsequently sealed by the marriage
of a daughter of Gonzalez with Don Ordoño, eldest
son of Ramiro, and heir to the kingdom.</p>

<p>The Count of Castile was, however, too powerful a
vassal to continue long on peaceable terms with
a sovereign, an alliance with whose family had
more than ever smoothed the progressive ascent of
his pretensions. Soon after the accession of his
son-in-law Don Ordoño, he entered into an alliance
against him with the King of Navarre. This declaration
of hostility was followed by the divorce
of Fernan's daughter by the King, who immediately
entered into a second wedlock. The successor of
this monarch, Don Sancho, surnamed the Fat, was
indebted for a large portion of his misfortunes and
vicissitudes to the hostility of the Count of Castile.
Don Ordoño, the pretender to his throne, son of
Alonzo surnamed the Monk, with the aid of Gonzalez,<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a>
whose daughter Urraca, the repudiated widow
of the former sovereign, he married, took easy
possession of the kingdom, driving Don Sancho for
shelter to the court of his uncle the then King of
Navarre. It is worth mentioning, that King Sancho
took the opportunity of his temporary expulsion
from his states, to visit the court of Abderahman
at Cordova, and consult the Arab physicians,
whose reputation for skill in the removal of obesity
had extended over all Spain. History relates that
the treatment they employed was successful, and
that Don Sancho, on reascending his throne, had
undergone so complete a reduction as to be destitute
of all claims to his previously acquired <i>sobriquet</i>.</p>

<p>All these events, and the intervals which separated
them, fill a considerable space of time; and the establishment
of the exact dates would be a very difficult,
if not an impossible, undertaking. Various wars
were carried on during this time by Gonzalez, and
alliances formed and dissolved. Several more or
less successful campaigns are recorded against the
Moors of Saragoza, and of other neighbouring states.
The alliance with Navarre had not been durable. In
959 Don Garcia, King of that country, fought a
battle with Fernan Gonzalez, by whom he was
taken prisoner, and detained in Burgos thirteen<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a>
months. The conquest of the independence of
Castile is related in the following manner.</p>

<p>In the year 958, the Cortes of the kingdom
were assembled at Leon, whence the King forwarded
a special invitation to the Count of Castile, requiring
his attendance, and that of the Grandees of the
province, for "deliberation on affairs of high importance
to the state." Gonzalez, although suspicious
of the intentions of the sovereign, unable
to devise a suitable pretext for absenting himself,
repaired to Leon, attended by a considerable <i>cortége</i>
of nobles. The King went forth to receive him;
and it is related, that refusing to accept a present,
offered by Gonzalez, of a horse and a falcon, both
of great value, a price was agreed on; with the
condition that, in case the King should not pay the
money on the day named in the agreement, for each
successive day that should intervene until the payment,
the sum should be doubled. Nothing extraordinary
took place during the remainder of the visit;
and the Count, on his return to Burgos, married
Doña Sancha, sister of the King of Navarre.</p>

<p>It is probable that some treachery had been intended
against Gonzalez, similar to that put in
execution on a like occasion previous to his birth,
when the Counts of Castile were seized and put
to death in their prison; for, not long after, a second<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a>
invitation was accepted by the Count, who was
now received in a very different manner. On his
kneeling to kiss the King's hand, Don Sancho burst
forth with a volley of reproaches, and, repulsing him
with fury, gave orders for his immediate imprisonment.
It is doubtful what fate was reserved for
him by the hatred of the Queen-mother, who had
instigated the King to the act of treachery, in
liquidation of an ancient personal debt of vengeance
of her own, had not the Countess of Castile,
Doña Sancha, undertaken his liberation.</p>

<p>Upon receiving the news of her husband's imprisonment,
she allowed a short period to elapse,
in order to mature her plan, and at the same
time lull suspicion of her intentions. She then
repaired to Leon, on pretext of a pilgrimage to
Santiago, on the route to which place Leon is
situated. She was received by King Sancho with
distinguished honours, and obtained permission to
visit her husband, and to pass a night in his prison.
The following morning, Gonzalez, taking advantage
of early twilight, passed the prison-doors in disguise
of the Countess, and, mounting a horse which was
in readiness, escaped to Castile.</p>

<p>This exploit of Doña Sancha does not belong to
the days of romance and chivalry alone: it reminds
us of the still more difficult task, accomplished by<a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a>
the beautiful Winifred, Countess of Nithisdale, who,
eight centuries later, effected the escape of the
rebel Earl, her husband, from the Tower, in a
precisely similar manner; thus rescuing him from
the tragic fate of his friends and fellow-prisoners,
the Lords Derwentwater and Kenmure.</p>

<p>Doña Sancha obtained her liberty without difficulty,
being even complimented by the King on her
heroism, and provided with a brilliant escort on her
return to Castile. Gonzalez contented himself with
claiming the price agreed upon for the horse and
falcon; and&mdash;the King not seeming inclined to liquidate
the debt, which, owing to the long delay, amounted
already to an enormous sum, or looking upon it
as a pretext for hostility, the absence of which would
not prevent the Count of Castile, in his then state
of exasperation, from having recourse to arms&mdash;passed
the frontier of Leon at the head of an army, and,
laying waste the country, approached gradually
nearer to the capital. At length Don Sancho sent
his treasurer to clear up the account, but it was
found that the debt exceeded the whole amount of
the royal treasure; upon which Gonzalez claimed
and obtained, on condition of the withdrawal of his
troops, a formal definitive grant of Castile, without
reservation, to himself and his descendants.</p>

<p>Before we quit Burgos for its environs, one more<a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a>
edifice requires our notice. It is a fountain, occupying
the centre of the space which faces the principal
front of the cathedral. This little antique
monument charms, by the quaint symmetry of its
design and proportions, and perhaps even by the
terribly mutilated state of the four fragments of
Cupids, which, riding on the necks of the same
number of animals so maltreated as to render impossible
the discovery of their race, form projecting
angles, and support the basin on their shoulders.
Four mermaids, holding up their tails, so as not
to interfere with the operations of the Cupids,
ornament the sides of the basin, which are provided
with small apertures for the escape of the water;
the top being covered by a flat circular stone,
carved around its edge. This stone,&mdash;a small, elegantly
shaped pedestal, which surmounts it,&mdash;and
the other portions already described, are nearly
black, probably from antiquity; but on the pedestal
stands a little marble virgin, as white as snow.
This antique figure harmonises by its mutilation
with the rest, although injured in a smaller degree;
and at the same time adds to the charm of the
whole, by the contrast of its dazzling whiteness
with the dark mass on which it is supported. The
whole is balanced on the capital of a pillar, of a<a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a>
most original form, which appears immediately above
the surface of a sheet of water enclosed in a large
octagonal basin.</p>

<h5>CARTUJA DE MIRAFLORES. CONVENT OF LAS HUELGAS.</h5>

<p class="r">Burgos.<br />
</p>

<p>The Chartreuse of Miraflores, situated to the
east of the city, half-way in the direction of the
above-mentioned monastery of San Pedro de Cardeñas,
crowns the brow of an eminence, which,
clothed with woods towards its base, slopes gradually
until it reaches the river. This spot is the most
picturesque to be found in the environs of Burgos,&mdash;a
region little favoured in that respect. The view,
extending right and left, follows the course of the
river, until it is bounded on the west by the town,
and on the east by a chain of mountains, a branch
of the Sierra of Oca. Henry the Third, grandfather
of Isabel the Catholic, made choice of this
position for the erection of a palace; the only
remnant of it now existing is the church, which
has since become the inheritance of the Carthusian
monks, the successors of its royal founder.<a name="page_071" id="page_071"></a></p>

<p>The late revolution, after sparing the throne of
Spain, displayed a certain degree of logic, if not in
all its acts, at least in sparing, likewise, two or
three of the religious establishments, under the protection
of which the principal royal mausoleums
found shelter and preservation. The great Chartreuse
of Xeres contained probably no such palladium,
for it was among the first of the condemned:
its lands and buildings were confiscated; and its
treasures of art, and all portable riches, dispersed,
as likewise its inhabitants, in the direction of all
the winds.</p>

<p>In England the name of Xeres is only generally
known in connection with one of the principal
objects of necessity, which furnish the table of the
<i>gastronome</i>; but in Andalucia the name of Xeres de
la Frontera calls up ideas of a different sort. It is
dear to the wanderer in Spain, whose recollections
love to repose on its picturesque position, its sunny
skies, its delicious fruits, its amiable and lively
population, and lastly on its once magnificent monastery,
and the treasures of art it contained. The
Prior of that monastery has been removed to the
Cartuja of Burgos, where he presides over a community,
reduced to four monks, who subsist almost
entirely on charity. This amiable and gentleman-like
individual, in whom the monk has in no degree<a name="page_072" id="page_072"></a>
injured the man of the world,&mdash;although a large
estate, abandoned for the cloister, proved sufficiently
the sincerity of his religious professions,&mdash;had well
deserved a better fate than to be torn in his old age
from his warm Andalucian retreat, and transplanted to
the rudest spot in the whole Peninsula, placed at an
elevation of more than four thousand feet above the
level of the Atlantic, and visited up to the middle of
June by snow-storms. At the moment I am writing,
this innocent victim of reform is extended on a bed
of sickness, having only recently escaped with his
life from an attack, during which he was given
over.</p>

<p>This Cartuja possesses more than the historical
reminiscences with which it is connected, to attract
the passing tourist. It owes its prolonged existence to
the possession of an admirable work of art,&mdash;the tomb
of Juan the Second and his Queen Isabel, which stands
immediately in front of the high altar of the church.
This living mass of alabaster, the work of Gil de Siloë,
son of the celebrated Diego, presents in its general
plan the form of a star. It turns one of its points to
the altar. Its mass, or thickness from the ground
to the surface, measures about six feet; and this is
consequently the height at which are laid the two
recumbent figures.</p>

</div>

<p>It is impossible to conceive a work more elaborate<a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a>
than the details of the costumes of the King and
Queen. The imitation of lace and embroidery, the
exquisite delicacy of the hands and features, the
infinitely minute carving of the pillows, the architectural
railing by which the two statues are separated,
the groups of sporting lions and dogs placed
against the foot-boards, and the statues of the four
Evangelists, seated at the four points of the star
which face the cardinal points of the compass,&mdash;all
these attract first the attention as they occupy the
surface; but they are nothing to the profusion of
ornament lavished on the sides. The chisel of the
artist has followed each retreating and advancing
angle of the star, filling the innermost recesses with
life and movement. It would be endless to enter
into a detailed enumeration of all this. It is composed
of lions and lionesses, panthers, dogs,&mdash;crouching,
lying, sitting, rampant, and standing; of saints,
male and female, and personifications of the cardinal
virtues. These figures are represented in every
variety of posture,&mdash;some standing on pedestals, and
others seated on beautifully wrought arm-chairs, but
all enclosed respectively in the richest Gothic tracery,
and under cover of their respective niches. Were
there no other object of interest at Burgos, this
tomb would well repay the traveller for a halt of a
few days, and a country walk.<a name="page_074" id="page_074"></a></p>

<p>At the opposite side of the town may be seen the
royal convent of Las Huelgas; but as the nuns reserve
to themselves the greater part of the church, including
the royal tombs, which are said to be very
numerous, no one can penetrate to satisfy his curiosity.
It is, however, so celebrated an establishment,
and of such easy access from the town, that a
sight of what portions of the buildings are accessible
deserves the effort of the two hundred yards' walk
which separates it from the river promenade. This
Cistercian convent was founded towards the end of
the twelfth century by Alonzo the Eighth,&mdash;the same
who won the famous battle of the Navas de Tolosa.
It occupies the site of the pleasure-grounds of a royal
retreat, as is indicated by the name itself. In its
origin it was destined for the reception, exclusively,
of princesses of the blood royal. It was consequently
designed on a scale of peculiar splendour.
Of the original buildings, however, only sufficient
traces remain to confirm the records of history, but not
to convey an adequate idea of their magnificence.
What with the depredations of time, the vicissitudes
of a situation in the midst of provinces so given to
contention, and repeated alterations, it has evidently,
as far as regards the portions to a view of which
admission can be obtained, yielded almost all claims
to identity with its ancient self.<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a></p>

<p>The entire church, with the exception of a small
portion partitioned off at the extremity, and containing
the high altar, is appropriated to the nuns, and
fitted up as a choir. It is very large; the length,
of which an estimate may be formed externally,
appearing to measure nearly three hundred feet.
It is said this edifice contains the tomb of the
founder, surrounded by forty others of princesses.
The entrance to the public portion consists of a
narrow vestibule, in which are several antique tombs.
They are of stone, covered with Gothic sculpture, and
appear, from the richness of their ornaments, to have
belonged also to royalty. They are stowed away,
and half built into the wall, as if there had not
been room for their reception. The convent is said
to contain handsome cloisters, courts, chapter-hall,
and other state apartments, all of a construction long
subsequent to its foundation. The whole is surrounded
by a complete circle of houses, occupied by
its various dependants and pensioners. These are
enclosed from without by a lofty wall, and face
the centre edifice, from which they are separated by
a series of large open areas. Their appearance is
that of a small town, surrounding a cathedral and
palace.</p>

<p>The convent of the Huelgas takes precedence of
all others in Spain. The abbess and her successors<a name="page_076" id="page_076"></a>
were invested by the sovereigns of Leon and Castile
with especial prerogatives, and with a sort of authority
over all convents within those kingdoms.
Her possessions were immense, and she enjoyed the
sovereign sway over an extensive district, including
several convents, thirteen towns, and about fifty
villages. In many respects her jurisdiction resembles
that of a bishop. The following is the formula
which heads her official acts:</p>

<p>"We, Doña ..., by the grace of God and of the
Holy Apostolic See, Abbess of the royal monastery of
Las Huelgas near to the city of Burgos, order of the
Cister, habit of our father San Bernardo, Mistress,
Superior, Prelate, Mother, and lawful spiritual and
temporal Administrator of the said royal monastery,
and its hospital called 'the King's Hospital,' and of the
convents, churches, and hermitages of its filiation,
towns and villages of its jurisdiction, lordship, and
vassalage, in virtue of Apostolic bulls and concessions,
with all sorts of jurisdiction, proper, almost
episcopal, <i>nullius diocesis</i>, and with royal privileges,
since we exercise both jurisdictions, as is public and
notorious," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The hospital alluded to gives its name to a village,
about a quarter of a mile distant, called "Hospital
del Rey." This village is still in a sort of
feudal dependance on the abbess, and is the only<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a>
remaining source of revenue to the convent, having
been recently restored by a decree of Queen Isabella;
for the royal blood flowing in the veins of the present
abbess had not exempted her convent from the
common confiscation decreed by the revolution. The
hospital, situated in the centre of the village, is a
handsome edifice. The whole place is surrounded
by a wall, similar to that which encloses the convent
and its immediate dependances, and the entrance presents
a specimen of much architectural beauty. It
forms a small quadrangle, ornamented with an elegant
arcade, and balustrades of an original design.<a name="page_078" id="page_078"></a></p>

<h5>ROUTE TO MADRID. MUSEO.</h5>

<p class="r">Toledo.<br />
</p>

<p>The route from Burgos to Madrid presents few
objects of interest. The country is dreary and little
cultivated; indeed, much of it is incapable of culture.
For those who are unaccustomed to Spanish routes,
there may, indeed, be derived some amusement from
the inns, of which some very characteristic specimens
lie in their way. The Diligence halts for the night
at the Venta de Juanilla, a solitary edifice situated
at the foot of the last or highest <i>étage</i> of the Somo
Sierra, in order to leave the principal ascent for
the cool of early dawn. The building is seen
from a considerable distance, and looks large;
but is found, on nearer approach, to be a straggling
edifice of one story only.</p>

<p>It is a modern inn, and differs in some essential
points from the ancient Spanish <i>posada</i>,&mdash;perfect
specimens of which are met with at Briviesca and<a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a>
Burgos. In these the vestibule is at the same time a
cow-shed, sheepfold, stable, pigsty,&mdash;in fact, a spacious
Noah's Ark, in which are found specimens of all
living animals, that is, of all sizes, down to the most
minute; but for the purification of which it would
be requisite that the entire flood should pass within,
instead of on its outside. The original ark, moreover,
possessed the advantage of windows, the
absence of which causes no small embarrassment
to those who have to thread so promiscuous a
congregation, in order to reach the staircase; once at
the summit of which, it must be allowed, one meets
with cleanliness, and a certain degree of comfort.</p>

<p>The Venta de Juanilla, on the Somo Sierra, is a
newish, clean-looking habitation, especially the interior,
where one meets with an excellent supper,
and may feast the eyes on the sight of a printed card,
hanging on the wall of the dining-room, announcing
that luxury of exotic gastronomy&mdash;Champagne&mdash;at
three crowns a bottle: none were bold enough that
evening to ask for a specimen.</p>

<p>There is less of the exotic in the bed-room arrangements;
in fact, the building appears to have been
constructed by the Diligence proprietors to meet the
immediate necessity of the occasion. The Madrid
road being served by two Diligences, one, leaving
the capital, meets at this point, on its first night, the<a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a>
other, which approaches in the contrary direction.
In consequence of this arrangement, the edifice is
provided with exactly four dormitories,&mdash;two male,
and two female.</p>

<p>Nor is this the result of an intention to diminish
the numbers quartered in each male or female apartment;
on the contrary, two rooms would have answered
the purpose better than four, but for the inconvenience
and confusion which would have arisen
from the denizens of the Diligence destined to start
at a later hour being aroused from their slumbers,
and perhaps induced to depart by mistake, at the
signal for calling the travellers belonging to the
earlier conveyance,&mdash;the one starting at two o'clock
in the morning, and the other at three.</p>

<p>On the occasion of my <i>bivouaque</i> in this curious
establishment, an English couple, recently married,
happened to be among the number of my fellow-sufferers;
and the lady's report of the adventures of
the female dormitory of our Diligence afforded us
sufficient amusement to enliven the breakfast on
the other side of the mountain. It appeared, that,
during the hustling of the males into their enclosure,
a fond mother, moved by Heaven knows what
anxious apprehensions, had succeeded in abstracting
from the herd her son, a tender youth of fourteen.
Whether or not she expected to smuggle, without<a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a>
detection, this contraband article into the female pen
we could not determine. If she did, she reckoned
somewhat independently of her host; for on a fellow-traveller
entering in the dark, and groping about for
a considerable time in search of an unoccupied nest,
a sudden exclamation aroused the fatigued sleepers,
followed by loud complaints against those who had
admitted an interloper to this holy of holies of
feminine promiscuousness, to the exclusion of one
of its lawful occupants. The dispute ran high; but it
must be added to the already numerous proofs of the
superior energy proceeding from aroused maternal
feelings, that the intruder was maintained in his
usurped resting-place by his determined parent,
notwithstanding the discontent naturally caused by
such a proceeding.</p>

<p>We have now reached the centre of these provinces,
the destinies of which have offered to Europe
so singular an example of political vicissitude. It is
an attractive occupation, in studying the history of
this country, to watch the progress of the state, the
ancient capital of which we have just visited,&mdash;a
province which, from being probably the rudest and
poorest of the whole Peninsula, became the most
influential, the wealthiest, the focus of power, as it is
geographically the centre of Spain,&mdash;and to witness
its constantly progressive advance, as it gradually<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a>
drew within the range of its influence all the surrounding
states; exemplifying the dogged perseverance
of the Spanish character, which, notwithstanding
repeated defeat, undermined the Arab
power by imperceptible advances, and eventually
ridded the Peninsula of its long-established lords.
It is interesting to thread the intricate narrative of
intermarriages, treaties, wars, alliances, and successions,
interspersed with deeds of heroic chivalry and
of blackest treachery, composing the annals of
the different northern states of Spain; until at
length, the Christian domination having been borne
onward by successive advantages nearly to the extreme
southern shores of the Peninsula, a marriage
unites the two principal kingdoms, and leads to the
subjection of all Spain, as at present, under one
monarch.</p>

<p>It is still more attractive to repair subsequently to
the country itself; and from this central, pyramidal
summit&mdash;elevated by the hand of Nature to a higher
level than the rest of the Peninsula; its bare and
rugged surface exposed to all the less genial influences
of the elements, and crowned by its modern capital,
looking down in all directions, like a feudal castle
on the fairer and more fertile regions subject to its
dominion, and for the protection of which it is there
proudly situated,&mdash;to take a survey of this extraordinary<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a>
country, view the localities immortalized by
the eventful passages of its history, and muse on its
still varying destinies.</p>

<p>Madrid has in fact already experienced threatening
symptoms of the insecurity of this feudal tenure,
as it were, in virtue of which it enjoys the supreme
rank. Having no claim to superiority derived from
its commerce, the fertility of its territory, the facility
of its means of communication and intercourse with
the other parts of the kingdom or with foreign states,&mdash;nothing,
in fact, but its commanding and central
position, and the comparatively recent choice made of
it by the sovereigns for a residence; it has seen itself
rivalled, and at length surpassed in wealth and enterprize,
by Barcelona, and its right to be continued as
the seat of government questioned and attacked.
Its fall is probably imminent, should some remedy
not be applied before the intermittent revolutionary
fever, which has taken possession of the country,
makes further advances, or puts on chronic symptoms;
but its fate will be shared by the power
to which it owes its creation. No residence in
Europe bears a prouder and more monarchical aspect
than Madrid, nor is better suited for the abode of the
feudal pomp and etiquette of the most magnificent&mdash;in
its day&mdash;of European courts: but riding and
country sports have crossed the Channel, and are<a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a>
endeavouring to take root in France; fresco-painting
has invaded England; in Sicily marble porticoes
have been painted to imitate red bricks; and a Constitutional
monarchy is being erected in Spain.
Spaniards are not imitators, and cannot change their
nature, although red bricks should become the
materials of Italian <i>palazzi</i>, Frenchmen ride after
fox-hounds, and Englishmen be metamorphosed to
Michael Angelos. The Alcazar of Madrid, commanding
from its windows thirty miles of royal
domains, including the Escorial and several other
royal residences, is not destined to become the
abode of a monarch paid to receive directions from a
loquacious and corrupt house of deputies,&mdash;the utmost
result to be obtained from forcing on states a form of
government unsuited to their character. If the
Spanish reigning family, after having settled their
quarrel with regard to the succession, (if ever they
do so,) are compelled to accept a (so-called) Constitutional
form of government, with their knowledge
of the impossibility of its successful operation, they
will probably endeavour, in imitation of the highly
gifted sovereign of their neighbours, to stifle it, and
to administrate in spite of it; until, either wanting
the talent and energy necessary for the maintenance
of this false position, or their subjects, as may be
expected, getting impatient at finding themselves<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a>
mystified, a total overthrow will terminate the
experiment.</p>

<p>I am aware of the criticism to which this opinion
would be exposed in many quarters; I already hear
the contemptuous upbraidings, similar to those with
which the "exquisite," exulting in an unexceptionable
wardrobe, lashes the culprit whose shoulders are
guilty of a coat of the previous year's fashion. We
are told that the tendency of minds, the progress
of intellect, the spirit of the age,&mdash;all which, translated
into plain language, mean (if they mean anything)
the fashion,&mdash;require that nations should provide
themselves each with a new Liberal government;
claiming, in consideration of the fashionable
vogue and the expensive nature of the article, its
introduction (unlike other British manufactures)
duty-free. But it ought first to be established,
whether these larger interests of humanity are amenable
to the sceptre of so capricious a ruler as the
fashion. It appears to me, that nations should be
allowed to adapt their government to their respective
characters, dispositions, habits of life, and traditions.
All these are more dependant than is supposed
by those who possess not the habit of reflection,
on the race, the position, the soil and climate each
has received from nature, which, by the influence
they have exercised on their habits and dispositions,<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a>
have fitted them each for a form of constitution
equally appropriate to no other people;
since no two nations are similarly circumstanced,
not only in all these respects, but even in any one of
them.</p>

<p>What could be more Liberal than the monarchy of
Spain up to the accession of the Bourbon dynasty?
the kings never reigning but by the consent of their
subjects, and on the condition of unvarying respect
for their privileges; but never, when once seated on
the throne, checked and embarrassed in carrying
through the measures necessary for the administration
of the state. The monarch was a responsible but a
free monarch until these days, when an attempt is
being made to deprive him both of freedom of action
and responsibility&mdash;almost of utility, and to render
him a tool in the hands of a constantly varying succession
of needy advocates or military <i>parvenus</i>, whom
the chances of civil war or the gift of declamation
have placed in the way of disputing the ministerial
salaries, without having been able to furnish either
their hearts with the patriotism, or their heads with
the capacity, requisite for the useful and upright
administration of the empire. In Spain, the advocates
of continual change, in most cases in which
personal interest is not their moving spring, hope
to arrive ultimately at a republic. Now, no one<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a>
more than myself admires the theories of Constitutional
governments, of universal political power
and of republicanism: the last system would be
the best of all, were it only for the equality it is
to establish. But how are men to be equalised by
the manufacturers of a government? How are the
ignorant and uneducated to be furnished with legislative
capacity, or the poor or unprincipled armed
against the seductions of bribery? It is not, unfortunately,
in any one's power to accomplish these
requisite preliminary operations; without the performance
of which, these plausible theories will ever
lose their credit when brought to the test of experiment.
How is a republic to be durable without
the previous solution of the problem of the equalisation
of human capacities? In some countries
it may be almost attained for a time; in others,
never put in motion for an instant. No one more
than myself abhors tyranny and despotism; but,
after hearing and reading all the charges laid at
the door of Absolutism during the last quarter of
a century, I am at a loss to account for the still
greater evils and defects, existing in Constitutional
states, having been overlooked in the comparison.
The subject is far less free in France than in the
absolute states of Germany: and other appropriate
comparisons might be made which would bring us<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a>
still nearer home. I would ask the advocates for
putting in practice a republican form of government,
and by way of comparing the two extremes,
whether all the harm the Emperors of Russia have
ever done, or are likely to do until the end of the
world,&mdash;according to whatever sect the date of that
event be calculated,&mdash;will not knock under to one
week of the exploits of the French republicans of
the last century? And if we carry on the observation
to the consequences of that revolution, until we
arrive at the decimation of that fine country under
the military despotism which was necessarily its offspring,
we shall not find my argument weakened.</p>

<p>I entreat your pardon for this political digression,
which I am as happy to terminate as yourself. I
will only add, that, should the period be arrived for
the Spanish empire to undergo the lot of all human
things&mdash;decline and dissolution, it has no right to
complain, having had its day; but, should that moment
be still distant, let us hope to see that country,
so highly favoured by Nature, once more prosperous
under the institutions which raised her to the highest
level of power and prosperity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the elements of discord still exist in
a simmering state close to the brim of the cauldron,
and a mere spark will suffice at any moment to make
them bubble over. The inhabitants of Madrid are<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a>
in hourly expectation of this spark; and not without
reason, if the <i>on-dits</i> which circulate there, and reach
to the neighbouring towns, are deserving of credit.
Queen Christina, on her road from Paris to resume
virtually, if not nominally, the government, conceived
the imprudent idea of taking Rome in her
way. It is said that she confessed to the Pope, who,
in the solemn exercise of his authority as representative
of the Deity, declared to her that Spain
would never regain tranquillity until the possessions
of the clergy should be restored to them.</p>

<p>Whatever else may have passed during the interview
is not stated; but a deep impression was produced
on the conscience of the Queen, to which is
attributed the change in her appearance evident
to those who may happen to have seen her a few
months since in Paris. This short space of time
has produced on her features the effect of years.
She has lost her <i>embonpoint</i>, and acquired in its
place paleness and wrinkles. She is firmly resolved
to carry out the views of the Pope. Here, therefore,
is the difficulty. The leading members of her
party are among those who have profited largely by
the change of proprietorship which these vast possessions
have undergone: being the framers or abettors
of the decree, they were placed among the
nearest for the scramble. In the emptiness of the<a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a>
national treasury, they consider these acquisitions
their sole reward for the trouble of conducting the
revolution, and are prepared to defend them like
tigers.</p>

<p>When, therefore, Queen Christina proposed her
plan<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to Narvaez, she met with a flat refusal. He
replied, that such a decree would deluge the country
with blood. The following day he was advised to
give in his resignation. This he refused to do, and
another interview took place. The Queen-mother
insisted on his acceptance of the embassy to France.
He replied, that he certainly would obey her Majesty's
commands; but that, in that case, she would
not be surprised if he published the act of her
marriage with Muños, which was in his power.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
This would compel Christina to refund all the income
she has received as widow of Ferdinand the
Seventh. The interview ended angrily; and, doubtless,
recalled to Christina's recollection the still
higher presumption of the man, who owed to her
the exalted situation from which, on a former occasion,
he levelled his attack on her authority. I<a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a>
am not answerable for the authenticity of these
generally received reports; but they prove the unsettled
state of things, when the determined disposition
of the two opposite parties, and the nearly
equal balance of their force, are taken into consideration.</p>

<p>I was scarcely housed at Madrid, having only
quitted the hotel the previous day, when the news
reached me of the death of one of the fair and accomplished
young Countesses&mdash;the companions of
my journey from Bayonne to Burgos. You would
scarcely believe possible the regret this intelligence
occasioned me,&mdash;more particularly from the peculiar
circumstances of the occurrence. Her father had
recently arrived from France, and the house was
filled for the celebration of her birthday; but she
herself was forbidden to join the dinner-party,
being scarcely recovered from a severe attack of
small-pox. The father's weakness could not deny
her admission at dessert, and an ice. The following
day she was dead.</p>

<p>Acquaintances made on the high road advance far
more rapidly than those formed in the usual formal
intercourse of society. I can account in no other way
for the tinge of melancholy thrown over the commencement
of my sojourn at Madrid by this event,&mdash;befalling
a person whose society I had only enjoyed<a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a>
during three days, and whom I scarcely expected to
see again.</p>

<p>The modern capital of Spain is an elegant and
brilliant city, and a very agreeable residence; but
for the admirer of the picturesque, or the tourist
in search of historical <i>souvenirs</i>, it contains few
objects of attraction. The picture-gallery is, however,
a splendid exception; and, being the best in the
world, compensates, as you may easily suppose, for
the deficiency peculiar to Madrid in monuments
of architectural interest.</p>

<p>To put an end to the surprise you will experience
at the enumeration of such a profusion of
<i>chefs d'&#339;uvre</i> of the great masters as is here found,
it is necessary to lose sight of the present political
situation of Spain, and to transport ourselves to the
age of painting. At that time Spain was the most
powerful, and especially the most opulent empire
in Europe. Almost all Italy belonged to her; a
large portion actually owning allegiance to her
sceptre, and the remainder being subject to her paramount
influence. The familiarity which existed
between Charles the Fifth and Titian is well
known; as is likewise the anecdote of the pencil,
picked up and presented by the Emperor to the
artist, who had dropped it.</p>

<p>The same taste for, and patronage of, painting,<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a>
continued through the successive reigns, until the
period when painting itself died a natural death;
and anecdotes similar to that of Charles the Fifth
are related of Philip the Fourth and Velasquez.
All the works of art thus collected, and distributed
through the different palaces, have been recently
brought together, and placed in an edifice, some
time since commenced, and as yet not entirely completed.
Titian was the most favoured of all the Italian
painters, not only with respect to his familiar intercourse
with the Emperor, but also in a professional
point of view. The Museo contains no less than
forty of his best productions. Nor is it surprising
that the taste of the monarch, being formed by his
masterpieces, should extend its preference to the
rest of the Venetian school in a greater degree
than to the remaining Italian schools. There are,
however, ten pictures by Raffaelle, including the
Spasimo, considered by many to be his greatest
work.</p>

<p>A cause similar to that above named enables us
to account for the riches assembled in the Dutch
and Flemish rooms, among which may be counted
more than two hundred pictures of Teniers alone.
I should observe, that I am not answerable for this
last calculation; being indebted for my information
to the director, and distinguished artist, Don Jose<a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a>
Madrazo. There is no catalogue yet drawn up.
Rubens has a suite of rooms almost entirely to
himself, besides his just portion of the walls of the
gallery. The Vandykes and Rembrandts are in great
profusion. With regard to the Spanish schools, it
may be taken for granted that they are as well represented
as those of the foreign, although partially
subject, nations. The works of Velasquez are the
most numerous; which is accounted for by his
situation of painter to the Court, under Philip the
Fourth. There are sixty of his paintings.</p>

<span class="caption">ITALIAN GALLERY AT THE MUSEO, MADRID.</span>
</div><p><a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a></p>

<p>The Murillos are almost as numerous, and in his
best style: but Seville has retained the cream of
the genius of her most talented offspring; and even
at Madrid, in the collection of the Academy, there
is a Murillo&mdash;the Saint Elizabeth&mdash;superior to any
of those in the great gallery. It is much to be wished
that some artist, gifted with the pen of a Joshua
Reynolds, or even of a Mengs (author of a notice
on a small portion of these paintings), could be found,
who would undertake a complete critical review of
this superb gallery. All I presume to say on the
subject is, were the journey ten times longer and
more difficult, the view of the Madrid Museo would
not be too dearly purchased.</p>

<p>Before I left Madrid, I went to the palace, to
see the traces of the conspiracy of the 7th October,
remaining on the doors of the Queen's apartments.
You will recollect that the revolt of October
1842 was that in favour of Christina, when the three
officers, Concha, Leon, and Pezuela, with a battalion,
attacked the palace in the night, for the purpose
of carrying off the Queen and her sister. On the
failure of the attempt, owing to its having been prematurely
put in execution, the Brigadier Leon was
shot, and the two others escaped.</p>

<p>It appears that the execution of this officer, unlike
the greater number of these occurrences, caused a<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a>
strong sensation in Madrid, owing to the sympathy
excited by his popular character, and the impression
that he was the victim of jealousy in the mind of the
Regent. The fine speech, however, attributed to him
by some of the newspapers, was not pronounced by
him. His words were very few, and he uttered them
in a loud and clear tone, before giving the word of
command to his executioners. This, and his receiving
the fire without turning his back, were the only
incidents worthy of remark.</p>

<p>One of the two sentries stationed at the door of
the Queen's anteroom when I arrived, happened to
have played a conspicuous part on the eventful night.
The Queen was defended by the guard of hallebardiers,
which always mounts guard in the interior of
the palace. This sentinel informed me that he was
on guard that night, on the top step of the staircase,
when Leon, followed by a few officers, was seen to
come up. Beyond him and his fellow-sentry there
were only two more, who were posted at the door of
the Queen's anteroom, adjoining her sleeping apartment.
This door faces the whole length of the corridor,
with which, at a distance of about twenty yards,
the top of the staircase communicates. In order to
shield himself from the fire of the two sentinels at
the Queen's door, Leon grasped my informant by
the ribs right and left, and, raising him from the<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a>
ground, carried him, like a mummy, to the corridor;
and there, turning sharp to the left, up to the two
sentries, whom he summoned to give him admittance
in the name of the absent Christina.</p>

<p>On the soldiers' refusal, he gave orders to his battalion
to advance, and a pitched battle took place, which
was not ultimately decided until daybreak&mdash;seven
hours after. The terror of the little princesses, during
this night, may be imagined. Two bullets penetrated
into the bed-room; and the holes made by
about twenty more in the doors of some of the
state apartments communicating with the corridor,
are still preserved as souvenirs of the event. The
palace contains some well-painted ceilings by Mengs,
and is worthy of its reputation of one of the finest
residences in Europe. The staircase is superb. It
was here that Napoleon, entering the palace on the
occasion of his visit to Madrid, to install Joseph
Buonaparte in his kingdom, stopped on the first
landing; and, placing his hand on one of the white
marble lions which crouch on the balustrades, turned
to Joseph, and exclaimed, "Mon frère, vous serez
mieux logé que moi."</p>

<p>There is no road from Madrid to Toledo. On the
occasions of religious festivities, which are attended by
the court, the journey is performed by way of Aranjuez,
from which place a sort of road conducts to the ancient<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a>
capital of Spain. There is, however, for those
who object to add so much to the actual distance,
a track, known, in all its sinuosities, throughout its
depths and its shallows, around its bays, promontories,
islands, and peninsulas&mdash;to the driver of the
diligence, and to the mounted bearer of the mail;
both of whom travel on the same days of the week,
in order to furnish reciprocal aid, in case of damage
to either. A twenty-four hours' fall of rain renders
this track impassable by the usual conveyance; a
very unusual sort of carriage is consequently kept in
reserve for these occasions, and, as the period of my
journey happened to coincide with an uncommonly
aqueous disposition of the Castilian skies, I was fortunately
enabled to witness the less every day, and more
eventful transit, to which this arrangement gave rise.</p>

<p>Accordingly at four o'clock on an April morning&mdash;an
hour later than is the custom on the road from
France to Madrid&mdash;I ascended the steps of a carriage,
selected for its lightness, which to those who know
anything of Continental coach-building, conveys a
sufficient idea of its probable solidity. There was not
yet sufficient daylight to take a view of this fabric;
but I saw, by the aid of a lantern, my luggage lifted
into a sort of loose net, composed of straw-ropes, and
suspended between the hind wheels in precisely such
juxtaposition, as to make the portmanteaus, bags, &amp;c.<a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a>
bear the same topographic relation to the vehicle, as
the truffles do to a turkey, or the stuffing to a duck.
There was much grumbling about the quantity of my
luggage, and some hints thrown out, relative to the
additional perils, suspended over our heads, or rather,
under our seats, in consequence of the coincidence of
the unusual weight, with the bad state of the <i>road</i>,
as they termed it, and the acknowledged caducity of
the carriage. I really was, in fact, the only one to
blame; for I could not discover, besides my things,
more than two small valises belonging to all the
other six passengers together.</p>

<p>At length we set off, and at a distance of four
miles from Madrid, as day began to break, we broke
down.</p>

<p>The break-down was neither violent nor dangerous,
and was occasioned by the crash of a hind wheel,
while our pace did not exceed a walk: but it was
productive of some amusement, owing to the position,
near the corner of the vehicle which took the
greatest fancy to <i>terra firma</i>, of a not over heroic limb
of the Castilian law, who had endeavoured to be facetious
ever since our departure, and whose countenance
now exhibited the most grotesque symptoms of
real terror. Never, I am convinced, will those moments
be forgotten by that individual, whose vivacity
deserted him for the remainder of the journey;<a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a>
and whose attitude and expression, as his extended
arms failed to recover his centre of gravity exchanged
for the supine, folded-up posture, unavoidable
by the occupant at the lowest corner of a broken-down
vehicle,&mdash;while his thoughts wandered to his
absent offspring, whose fond smiles awaited him in
Toledo, but to whom perhaps he was not allowed
to bid an eternal adieu&mdash;will live likewise in the
memory of his fellow-travellers.</p>

<p>This <i>dénouement</i> of the adventures of the first carriage
rendered a long halt necessary; during which,
the postilion returned to Madrid on a mule, and
brought us out a second. This proceeding occupied
four hours, during which some entered a neighbouring
<i>venta</i>, others remained on the road, seated on
heaps of stones, and all breakfasted on what provisions
they had brought with them, or could procure
at the said <i>venta</i>. The sight of the vehicle that now
approached, would have been cheaply bought at the
price of twenty up-sets. Don Quixote would have
charged it, had such an apparition suddenly presented
itself to his view. It was called a phaeton,
but bore no sort of resemblance to the open carriage
known in England by that name. Its form
was remarkable by its length being out of all proportion
to its width,&mdash;so much so as to require three
widely-separated windows on each side. These were<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>
irregularly placed, instead of being alike on the
two sides, for the door appeared to have been forgotten
until after the completion of the fabric, and
to have taken subsequently the place of a window;
which window&mdash;pursuant to a praiseworthy sense
of justice&mdash;was provided for at the expense of a
portion of deal board, and some uniformity.</p>

<p>The machine possessed, nevertheless, allowing for
its rather exaggerated length, somewhat of the form
of an ancient landau; but the roof describing a
semicircle, gave it the appearance of having been
placed upside down by mistake, in lowering it on to
the wheels. Then, with regard to these wheels,
they certainly had nothing very extraordinary about
their appearance, when motionless; but, on being
subjected to a forward or backward impulse, they
assumed, respectively, and independently of each
other, such a zigzag movement, as would belong
to a rotatory, locomotive pendulum, should the progress
of mechanics ever attain to so complicated a
discovery. Indeed, the machine, in general, appeared
desirous of avoiding the monotony attendant on
a straight-forward movement; the body of the monster,
from the groans, sighs, screams, and other various
sounds which accompanied its heaving, pitching, and
rolling exertions, appearing to belong to some unwieldy
and agonised mammoth and to move by its<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>
own laborious efforts, instead of being indebted for
its progress to the half-dozen quadrupeds hooked to
its front projections.</p>

<p>The track along which this interesting production
of mechanical art now conveyed us, bore much resemblance
to a river, in the accidents of its course.
Thus we were reminded at frequent intervals, by
the suddenly increased speed of our progress, that
we were descending a rapid: at other times the motion
was so vertical, as to announce the passage down
a cataract. These incidents were not objectionable
to me, as they interrupted the monotony of the walking
pace, to which we were condemned; although one
or two passengers of rather burly proportions, seemed
not much to enjoy their repetition. However this
might be, assuredly we were none of us sorry to find
ourselves at eight o'clock that evening safely housed
at Toledo.<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a></p>

<h3><a name="LETTER_VIII" id="LETTER_VIII"></a>LETTER VIII.</h3>

<h5>PICTURESQUE POSITION OF TOLEDO. FLORINDA.</h5>

<p class="r">Toledo.<br />
</p>

<p>Every traveller&mdash;I don't mean every one who
habitually assists in wearing out roads, whether of
stone or iron&mdash;nor who travels for business, nor who
seeks to escape from himself&mdash;meaning from ennui,
(a vain attempt, by the way, if Horace is to be depended
on; since, even should he travel on horseback,
the most exhilarating sort of locomotion, ennui will
contrive to mount and ride pillion)&mdash;but every one
who deserves the name of traveller, who travels for
travelling sake, for the pleasure of travelling, knows
the intensity of the feeling which impels his right
hand, as he proceeds to open the window-shutter
of his bed-room, on the morning subsequent to his
nocturnal arrival in a new town.</p>

<p>The windows of the Posada del Miradero at Toledo
are so placed as by no means to diminish the
interest of this operation. The shutter being opened,
I found myself looking from a perpendicular elevation<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>
of several hundred feet, on one of the prettiest
views you can imagine. The town was at
my back, and the road by which we had arrived,
was cut in the side of the precipice beneath me. In
following that direction, the first object at all prominent
was the gate leading to Madrid&mdash;a cluster of
half Arab embattled towers and walls, standing somewhat
to the left at the bottom of the descent. These
gave issue to the track mentioned in my journey,
and which could now be traced straight in front,
to a considerable distance.</p>

<p>The ground rises slightly beyond the gates of the
town, and preserves a moderate elevation all across
the view, retreating right and left, so as to offer
the convex side of the arc of an immense circle. This
formation gives to the view a valley, extending on
either side, shut in on the left by mountains
at a distance of four miles; while to the east it extends
as far as the eye can reach,&mdash;some mountains,
scarcely perceptible, crossing it at the horizon. The
Tagus advances down the eastern valley from Aranjuez;
which château is in view at the distance of
twenty-eight miles, and approaching with innumerable
zigzags to the foot of the town, suddenly forms a
curve, and, dashing into the rocks, passes round the
back of the city, issues again into the western valley,
and, after another sharp turn to the left, resumes the<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>
same direction as before. All this tract of country
owes to the waters of the Tagus a richness of vegetation,
and a bright freshness nowhere surpassed.
So much for the distant view.</p>

<p>To judge of the nearer appearance of the town, I
crossed the bridge of Alcantara, placed at the entrance
of the eastern valley, and leading to Aranjuez.
The situation may be described in a few words. Toledo
stands on an eminence nearly circular in its
general form. It is a mass of jagged rock, almost
perpendicular on all its sides. The river flows rather
more than half round it, descending from the east,
and passing round its southern side. The left or south
bank is of the same precipitous formation; but, instead
of presenting that peculiarity during only a
short distance, it continues so both above and below
the town; while on the opposite side the only high
ground is the solitary mass of rock selected, whether
with a view to defence or to inconvenience, for the
position of this ancient city. The Tagus is crossed
by two bridges, one at each extremity of the semi-circle
described by it round the half of the town.
These bridges are both highly picturesque, from
their form no less than their situation. They are
raised upon arches of a height so disproportionate
to their width, as to appear like aqueducts; and are
provided at each extremity with towers, all, with one<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a>
exception, Moorish in their style. The lower bridge
(lower by position, for it is the higher of the two
in actual elevation) bears the name of San Martin,
and is traversed by the road to Estremadura; the
other leads to Aranjuez, and is the puente de Alcantara.
We are now standing on this last, having
passed under the Arab archway of its tower.</p>

<p>Its width is just sufficient for the passage of two
vehicles abreast, and it is covered with flag-paving.
The river flows sixty feet below. At the back of the
tower which faces you, at the opposite end of the
bridge, rises a rock, almost isolated from the rest of
the cliff, and on its top the half-ruined towers and
walls of a Moorish castle. On the left hand extends
the valley, through which the river approaches in
a broad mass. The road to Aranjuez follows the
same direction, after having first disappeared round
the base of the rock just mentioned, and is bordered
with rose-trees, and occasional groups of limes, which
separate it from the portions set apart for pedestrians.
On the right hand the river (still looking
from the bridge) is suddenly pressed in between
precipices, becomes narrow, and at the distance of
a few hundred yards, forms a noisy cascade.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 550px;">
<a href="images/ill_129_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_129_sml.jpg" width="550" height="370" alt="VIEW OF TOLEDO" title="VIEW OF TOLEDO" /></a>
<span class="caption">VIEW OF TOLEDO</span>
</div>

<p>Still looking in that direction, the left bank&mdash;a
rocky precipice, as I mentioned before&mdash;curves round
and soon hurries it out of sight. The lower part of<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a>
the opposite or town bank is ornamented, close to
the cascade, with a picturesque ruin, on which you
look down from your position. This consists of three
stories of arches, standing partly in the water.
Above and behind them rise a few larger buildings,
almost perpendicularly over each other, and the summit
is crowned with the colossal quadrangular mass
of the Alcazar.</p>

<p>The ruinous arches just mentioned, are the remains
of a building erected by a speculator, who had
conceived a plan for raising water to the Alcazar by
means of wheels, furnished with jars, according to the
custom of this part of Spain. The arrangement is
simple; the jars, being attached round a perpendicular
wheel, successively fill with water, as each arrives
at the bottom, and empty themselves, on reaching
the summit, into any receptacle placed so as to receive
their contents. The speculator, having to operate
on a colossal scale, intended probably to super-pose
wheel over wheel, and to establish reservoirs
at different elevations, as it would scarcely be possible
to work a wheel of such dimensions as to carry
jars to the height required (more than three hundred
feet), even though furnished with ropes, which are
made to turn round the wheel and descend below
it.</p>

<p>Crossing the bridge, the road quits the river, or<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>
rather is left for a certain space by it, until it meets
it at the distance of a mile. This road is a favourite
promenade of the inhabitants, and deservedly so. On
each side, for the distance of a mile, it is bordered by
hedges of magnificent rose-trees. These hedges are
double on both sides, enclosing walks for the promenaders
on foot. Behind those on the outside, the
colours are varied by the pale green of the olive-tree;
and over them occasional clusters of lime-trees,
mingled with the acacia and laburnum, furnish shade,
in case of an excess of sunshine. This promenade,
flanked on one side by the hills, and on the other,
by the highly cultivated plain, in parts of which the
Tagus is seen occasionally to peep through its wooded
banks, is most delicious during the rose season.
I should especially recommend the visitor of Toledo
to repair to it during the first hour after sunrise,
when thronged with birds, which are here almost
tame, and fill the air with their music; and also in
the evening, when frequented by the mantilla-hooded
fair of the city.</p>

<p>There is, however, notwithstanding the beauty and
gay appearance of this profusion of roses, a singular
effect produced by their situation. Usually seen surrounded
by other flowers or by well-kept grass or
earth, they do not look quite themselves on the side
on which they rest their bushy foundations on a<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>
dusty road, covered with deep ruts. The fish out of
water forms a hackneyed, not to say a dried up, comparison;
but we can compare the rather pallid and
unnatural appearance of these plants to that of a
bevy of ladies, who, tired of the monotony of a ball-room
in Grosvenor Place, should resolve, precisely
at the crisis when candle-light is more than ever required
for their rather suffering complexions, to compel
their partners to lead them, at sunrise, a galopade
down Tattersall's yard. The roses, thus misplaced,
are nevertheless roses, and cease not to be fair, in
spite of their unusual <i>entourage</i>, and to contribute
to the beauty and novelty of this picturesque promenade.</p>

<p>Amongst the variety of harmless weaknesses by
which human imagination, and consequently human
locomotion are influenced, I look upon one of the
most irresistible (if such an epithet be applicable
to a weakness) to be that fractional component part
of the cravings of antiquarianism, which urges some
persons in the search after, and rewards their labours
on the discovery of, the locality supposed to be the
birthscene of some great historical event, however
insignificant in other respects, or even however loathsome
its actual state may be to the outward senses.
Thus, when, in Normandy, the worthy and probably
waggish majordomo of the crumbling old castle of<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a>
Falaise, directs your attention to the window from
which Duke Robert caught the first glance of the
ankle of William the Conqueror's mother,&mdash;as she
pursued her professional labours, and polluted with
her soapsuds the silver brook a quarter of a mile
below him,&mdash;and suddenly yielded his soul to its irresistible
beauty: notwithstanding the impossibility of
the thing, many, and I confess myself one, are too
delighted with the window, and the rivulet, and the
majordomo, and the&mdash;God knows what!&mdash;perhaps
with the very impossibility&mdash;to allow themselves a
moment's sceptical or sarcastic feeling on the subject.</p>

<p>I should mention that my visit to Falaise happening
to take place shortly after the passage of the
King of the French on a tour through his western
provinces, the aforesaid cicerone pointed out a highly
suspicious-looking inscription, being the initials of
the monarch, carefully engraved in the stone; which
he informed me had been cut by Louis Philippe, on
the occasion of his visit at midnight to the room
of Duke Robert; but of which I took the liberty
of suspecting himself of being the sculptor, during
some idle moment,&mdash;fond as he probably was of contemplating
the innocently expressive countenances
of his satisfied visitors.</p>

<p>Actuated by the feeling I have attempted to describe,
one of my first inquiries at Toledo related to<a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>
the well-known story of Florinda and her bath, so
fatal to the Gothic sway in Spain. I was immediately
directed to the spot, on which is seen a square
tower, pierced by arched openings through its two
opposite sides, and on a third side by a similar but
smaller aperture. The four walls alone remain,
and the whole is uncovered. This symmetrical-looking
edifice, well built and composed of large stones,
measures about sixteen feet square, and from forty
to fifty in elevation, and stands on the edge of
the river, on the town side, about a hundred yards
below the western bridge&mdash;that called after Saint
Martin&mdash;at the precise point at which the river
quits the town, and its north bank ceases to be
precipitous.</p>

<p>The extreme point of the termination of the high
ground is immediately over the building, and is
covered with the ruins of King Roderick's palace,
the outer walls of which descend to the water, and
are terminated by a small roundtower within a
few yards of the quadrangular edifice. The edifice
is called the Baño de la Cava, meaning Florinda's
bath, although the native popular tradition,
losing sight of the events of the history, has metamorphosed
the heroine of the spot into a Moorish
princess.</p>

<p>In fact, the rocky precipice terminates at this<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>
spot,&mdash;the last piece of rock forming part of the foundation
of the square tower, immediately beyond
which is a gently descending sand-bank most convenient
and tempting to bathers. This circumstance,
added to the situation of Roderick's residence, immediately
above the scene, was delightfully corroborative
of the tradition; and proved sufficiently, had
all investigation ceased there, the identity of the spot
with the scene of the anecdote. Owing to an excess
of curiosity a new discovery threw a doubt over the
whole affair.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 423px;">
<a href="images/ill_136_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_136_sml.jpg" width="423" height="550" alt="FLORINDA&#39;S BATH." title="FLORINDA&#39;S BATH." /></a>
<span class="caption">FLORINDA&#39;S BATH.</span>
</div><p><a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a></p>

<p>A bridge is too public a thoroughfare to allow
of bathing to be practised in its immediate neighbourhood:
and, in fact, the erection of the neighbouring
one of St. Martin is of much later date
than the events of the history in question. Fatal
curiosity, however, led me to the back of the building,&mdash;the
very bath of Florinda,&mdash;where it was impossible
not to discover, even to conviction, that it, the square
tower itself, had formerly been the entrance of a
bridge. This is proved by the ruins of two piers,
which appear above the water,&mdash;one near to the
shore on which I was standing, the other near to
the opposite bank, and both forming a line with the
square tower on looking through its two opposite
arches. The tower possesses other peculiarities
which, compared with those belonging to the bridges
actually in existence, fully confirm the supposition.</p>

<p>Now, although the tradition has christened the
spot Baño de la Cava, which expression is translated
"bath of the prostitute," it is certain that Florinda
was the daughter of Count Julian, governor of the
Spanish possessions in Africa, and a personage of
sufficient rank and influence to obtain a hearing
at the court of the Arab Caliph, or at all events
of his viceroy in Africa, and to conceive the idea
of calling a foreign army to execute his private
vengeance. It is therefore extremely improbable that<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a>
the daughter of such a person should have been
seen to measure and compare the proportions of
her legs with those of her companions in the immediate
vicinity of a bridge, necessarily the most
frequented of thoroughfares.</p>

<p>I confess I left the spot filled with disappointment.
In vain I reflected that after all the fact
is fact&mdash;that the sensual Roderick may certainly
have spied from behind a window-lattice the frolics
of some ladies at their bath; and that, wherever his
<i>espionage</i> took place, he may for that purpose have
intentionally procured himself a place of concealment,
and have formed the resolution of possessing
one of them. In fact, it was a matter of indifference
to me whether the circumstance had occurred or
not, provided I should ascertain its whereabouts, supposing
it real, instead of merely discovering the spot
on which it did not take place.</p>

<p>Having thus convicted the generally received tradition
of deceit,&mdash;at least, in one of its parts,&mdash;it became
an object to discover some other version of the
story, which might tally in a more satisfactory manner
with present existing proofs. The Arab historians
deny the invasion to have been brought
about by any such occurrence; but Mariana, copied
by more recent writers, has either discovered or
compiled a very plausible story, clear in its details,<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>
only erroneous in respect of the heroine's name,
which he makes out to be Cava. From this version
the bath is entirely excluded.</p>

<p>According to the custom in Gothic Spain, the sons
of the nobles received their education in the royal
palace, and on attaining the age of manhood, they
formed an escort round the sovereign on all expeditions,
whether to the field or the chase. Their
daughters were likewise entrusted to the care of
royalty, and attended the person of the Queen, after
having completed their education and instruction in
the accomplishments suited to their sex, under her
superintendence. When these noble damsels could
number sufficient summers, their hands were bestowed
according to the royal selection.</p>

<p>Among the attendants of Queen Egilona, was a
daughter of Count Julian, possessed of extreme
beauty. Florinda, while playing with her companions
in a garden, situated on the banks of the
Tagus, and overlooked by a tower, which contained
a portion of Don Rodrigo's apartments, exposed to
view, more than accorded either with etiquette or
with her intention, the symmetry of her form. King
Rodrigo, who, favoured by the concealment of a window-blind,
had been watching the whole scene, became
suddenly enamoured of her, and resolved to
obtain a return of his passion; but, after finding<a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a>
every effort useless, and his object unattainable, he
at length employed violence.</p>

<p>Every circumstance of this story is corroborated,
as far as is possible in the present time, by the position
of the localities, the known customs of the
period, and the character of King Roderick. But
the historian Mariana, to show the minuteness and
triumph of research, on which he has founded his
relation, quotes the young lady's own version of
the affair; in fact, no less interesting a document
than her letter to her father, then in Africa, disclosing
the insult offered to the family. The following
is the translation of this portentous dispatch.
A <i>billet-doux</i> pregnant with greater events never
issued from the boudoir of beauty and innocence.</p>

<p>"Would to Heaven, my lord and father!&mdash;Would
to Heaven the earth had closed over me, before it
fell to my lot to write these lines, and with such
grievous news to cause you sadness and perpetual
regret! How many are the tears that flow while
I am writing, these blots and erasures are witnesses.
And yet if I do not immediately, I shall cause a
suspicion that not only the body has been polluted,
but the soul likewise blotted and stained with perpetual
infamy. Would I could foresee a term to
our misery!&mdash;Who but yourself shall find a remedy
for our misfortunes? Shall we delay, until time<a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a>
brings to light that which is now a secret, and the
affront we have received entail on us a shame more
intolerable than death itself? I blush to write that
which I am bound to divulge. O wretched and
miserable fate! In a word, your daughter&mdash;your
blood, that of the kingly line of the Goths, has
suffered from King Rodrigo,&mdash;to whose care, alas! she
was entrusted like the sheep to the wolf,&mdash;a most
wicked and cruel affront. It is for you, if you
are worthy the name of a man, to cause the sweet
draught of our ruin to become a deadly poison to
his life; nor to leave unpunished the mockery and
insult he has cast on our line and on our house."</p>

<p>Don Julian, who, as some say, was of royal descent,
and a relative, not far removed, of Roderick&mdash;was
possessed of qualities no less marked by daring than
artifice. His plans well digested, he committed his
government in Africa to the charge of a deputy, and
repaired to the court at Toledo. There he made
it his business to advance in credit and favour until
the moment should arrive for action. His first step
was, by means of false alarms of attacks meditated
on the northern frontier, to get rid of the principal
part of the disposable forces in that direction. Meanwhile
he caused a letter from his Countess, who remained
in Africa, to be forwarded to the King, in
which, on the plea of serious illness, she urgently<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>
entreats the royal permission for the departure of
Florinda to Ceuta. It is related that the profligate
Rodrigo consented to the journey with so much the
better grace, that possession had divested the attractions
of his victim of all further hold of his passions,
already under the dominion of new allurements.</p>

<p>There is a gate at Malaga, giving issue towards
the sea-shore, which bears to this day the name of
Gate of the Cava: through it she is said to have
passed on embarking for Africa.</p>

<p>With regard to the name "la Cava" given to the
gate and to the bath, I am disposed to prefer the
popular notion to the assertion of Mariana, that it
was her name. It is a natural supposition that the
anecdote of the affair of Toledo, spread among the
Arabs, who, for centuries after this period, were the
depositaries of the annals and traditions of the Peninsula,&mdash;should
have become tinted with a colour derived
from their customs and ideas. Now it would
be difficult to persuade an Arab that the circumstances
of the story in question could befall a virtuous
female, surrounded with the thousand precautions
peculiar to an oriental court. If we add to
this the contemptuous tone assumed by them towards
those of the hostile creed&mdash;a tone that must have
suited in an especial degree with their way of thinking
on the subject of female deportment among the<a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a>
Christians, which they look upon as totally devoid of
delicacy and reserve&mdash;the epithet applied to Florinda
is easily accounted for. But to return to the story.</p>

<p>It only now remained for Don Julian to determine
the Caliph's viceroy in Africa in favour of the invasion.
Repairing to his court, he obtained an
audience, in which he painted to the Prince, in such
eloquent terms, the natural and artificial wealth
of the Spanish peninsula, the facility of the enterprise,
owing to the absence of the principal part
of the disposable hostile force, and the unpopularity
of King Rodrigo, that an expedition was immediately
ordered; which, although at first prudently
limited to a small troop under Tharig, led to the
conquest, in a few campaigns, of the whole Peninsula.</p>

<p>Mingled with the ruins of Roderick's palace are
seen at present those of the monastery of Saint
Augustin, subsequently erected on the same site:
but on the side facing the river, the ancient wall
and turrets, almost confounded with the rock, on
which they were built, have outlived the more recent
erections, or perhaps have not been interfered
with by them. Immediately beyond the portion
of these walls, beneath which is seen the Baño de
la Cava, they turn, together with the brink of the
precipice, abruptly to the north, forming a right<a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a>
angle with the river bank: this part faces the western
<i>vega</i> or valley, and looks down on the site of the
ancient palace gardens, which occupied the first low
ground. They extended as far as the chapel of
Santa Leocadia. The ground is now traversed by
the road to the celebrated sword-blade manufactory,
situated on the bank of the river, half a mile lower
down. With the exception of the inmates of that
establishment, the only human beings who frequent
the spot are the votaries on their way to the shrine
of Santa Leocadia, and the convicts of a neighbouring
<i>Presidio</i> in search of water from the river.<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a></p>

<h3><a name="LETTER_IX" id="LETTER_IX"></a>LETTER IX.</h3>

<h5>CATHEDRAL OF TOLEDO.</h5>

<p class="r">Toledo.<br />
</p>

<p>Every successive æra of civilization, with the concomitant
religion on which it has been founded,
and from which it has taken its peculiar mould, has,
after maintaining its ground with more or less lustre,
and throughout a greater or smaller duration,
arrived at its inevitable period of decline and overthrow.</p>

<p>In ceasing, however, to live, and to fill society
far and wide with its enlightening influence,&mdash;in
exchanging its erect attitude for the prostrate one
consequent on its fall,&mdash;seldom has a creed, which has
long held possession of the most enlightened intellects
of our race for the time being, undergone an
entire extinction, so as to disappear altogether from
the face of the earth, and leave no trace of its existence.
The influence of the soil, formation, and
climate of the region, in the bosom of which such<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a>
civilization has had its birth, on the dispositions
and faculties of the race which has become its depositary,
has always set its peculiar mark on its
monuments, whether civil, military, or religious,
but especially the last; which monuments, surviving
the reign of the power to which they owe their
existence, prolong and sanctify its memory, while
they stand, erect and silent, over its grave; and
furnish valuable information and benefit to those
future generations sufficiently enlightened to consult
them.</p>

<p>If this theory of successions and vicissitudes be
consonant (which probably no one will deny) with
the march of events on the surface of this our planet,
then do the circumstances of the present situation
invest, as far as regards Spain, those relics of human
genius and human enthusiasm, the venerable temples
of her declining faith, with an interest beyond that
which they have possessed at any period since their
foundation. It is impossible to have paid any attention
to the events of the last few years, without having
received the conviction that the reign of Christianity
is here fast approaching,&mdash;not the commencement,
but the termination of its decline. Spaniards will
never do things by halves; and will probably prefer
the entire overthrow of ancient customs to the system
pursued in France, of propping up, by government<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>
enactments and salaries, a tottering edifice of external
forms, long since divested of its foundation
of public belief.</p>

<p>To speak correctly, the decline of religious supremacy
in Spain is by no means recent. It was coeval
with that of the arts, and of the political grandeur
of the country. The gradual cessation of the vast
gifts and endowments for the erection of the religious
establishments was a symptom of devotional
enthusiasm having passed its zenith. Had not this
occurred nearly three centuries back, Madrid would
not have wanted a Cathedral. Nothing could ever
have tended more directly to compromise the durability
of Christianity in Spain, than the final expulsion
or extermination of the Moors and Jews. Had
Torquemada and a few others possessed heads as
clear and calculating as their hearts were resolute and
inexorable&mdash;a knowledge of human nature as profound
as their ambition of divine honours was exalted,
they would have taken care not entirely to
deprive the Church of food for its passions and energies.
They would not have devoured all their heretics
at a single meal, but would have exercised more
<i>ménagement</i> and less voracity. They would have
foreseen that by burning a few hundred Jews and
Arabs less each year, nourishment would remain to
animate the declamations of preachers, and the energies<a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a>
of the faithful; without which the fatal effects
of sloth and indifference must inevitably take root
in the imaginations, and eventually undermine their
lofty fabric.</p>

<p>The decline was, however, so gradual as to exercise
no perceptible influence on the general conduct
of the population, by whom forms were still
observed, churches filled, and acts of devotion unceasingly
accomplished. A variety of causes (into
a description of which it is not my object, nor would
it be your wish, that I should enter, but of which
one of the most influential has been the importation
of foreign ideas&mdash;as well through natural channels,
as by special and interested exertions) has precipitated
the <i>dénouement</i> of this long-commenced
revolution; and that with so headlong a rapidity,
that, in that Spain which surpassed all other nations
in bigoted attachment to religious rites, the confiscation
of all the possessions of the Church, under a
promise (not to be performed) of salaries for a certain
number of ecclesiastics, insufficient for the continuation
of the ancient ceremonies, is received by
the population with indifference! The Cathedral
of Toledo, deprived of the greater number of its
functionaries,&mdash;including its archbishop and fifty-six
of its sixty canons, and no longer possessing, out of
an income of hundreds of thousands sterling, a treasure<a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>
sufficient for providing brooms and sweepers
for its pavement,&mdash;will, in perhaps not much more
than another year, if the predictions of the inhabitants
be verified, be finally closed to public worship.</p>

<p>The same interest, therefore, which surrounded
the Arab monuments three centuries since, and the
Roman edifices of Spain in the fifth century, attaches
itself now to the Christian temples; which, at this
crisis, offer themselves to the tourist in the sad but attractive
gloom of approaching death; since depriving
them of the pomp and observances which filled their
tall arcades with animation, is equivalent to separating
a soul from a body. He will explore them and
examine their ceremonies with all the eagerness
and perseverance of a last opportunity,&mdash;he will
wander untired through the mysterious twilight
of their arched recesses, and muse on the riches
lavished around him to so little purpose, and on
the hopes of those who entrusted their memories
to the guardianship of so frail and transient a depositary.
The tones of their giant though melodious
voices, as, sent from a thousand brazen throats,
they roll through the vaulted space the dirge of
their approaching fate, will fill him with sadness;
and the ray that streams upon him from each crimson
and blue <i>rosace</i> will fix itself on his memory, kindling<a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>
around it an inextinguishable warmth, as though
he had witnessed the smile of a departing saint.</p>

<p>I had read of Toledo being in possession of the
finest church in Spain,&mdash;and <i>that</i> in the book of a
tourist, whose visit to this town follows immediately
that to Seville. Begging pardon of the clever and
entertaining writer to whom I allude, the Cathedral
of Toledo strikes me as far from being the
finest in Spain; nor would it be the finest in France,
nor in England, nor in other countries that might
be enumerated, could it be transported to either.
It is large; but in this respect it yields to that
of Seville. What its other claims to pre-eminence
may be, it is difficult to discover. It is true that
its interior presents a specimen of the simple and
grand pointed style of its period. This being put
in execution on a large scale, would render it an
imposing and a beautiful edifice, but for a subsequent
addition, which, to render justice to the architect,
he certainly never could have contemplated.
The noble pillars, towering to a height of sixty feet,
have been clothed, together with their capitals, in
a magnificent coat of whitewash! Without having
witnessed such a desecration in this or some similar
edifice, it is impossible to conceive the deadening
effect it produces on the feeling of admiration such
a building ought to excite. An inscription in distinct<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a>
and large characters, over the southernmost
of the three western doors, after recording the conquest
of Granada by the Catholic Kings, as Ferdinand
and Isabella are here termed, the expulsion
of the Jews, and the completion of the Cathedral,
brands with this act of barbarism one Don Francisco
Fernandez de Cuença, <i>obrero mayor</i> (almost a Dean)
of the Cathedral in the year 1493.</p>

<p>There is, however, a moment of each day when
the tall arcades vindicate their outraged majesty.
"La nuit tous les chats sont gris," says the proverb.
I therefore proceeded at the approach of twilight
(all access at a later hour being prohibited) to see
whether its application would extend to this church.
This is, in fact, the hour, just before the closing
of the doors, at which it should be visited. Darkness
has assumed his empire within these walls long
before the stirring labyrinth without has had warning
of his approach. No colours nor gildings (the
latter being rather injudiciously distributed) are
visible&mdash;nothing but a superb range of beautifully
painted windows; and the columns only trace their
dim outline a little less black against the deep gloom
of the rest of the building. At this hour, could
it last, it would be impossible to tire of wandering
through this forest of magnificent stems, of which
the branches are only seen to spring, and immediately<a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a>
lose themselves beneath the glories of the
coloured transparencies rendered doubly brilliant
by their contrast with the gloom of all below them.
The principal merit, in fact, of this edifice, consists
in its windows. That of the purity of its
general style deserves also to be allowed; but
with some reserve in the appreciation of the accessory
points of the design. It depended, for
instance, on the judgment of the architect, to
diminish or to increase the number of columns
which separate the different naves, and by their
unnecessary abundance he has impaired the grandeur
of the general effect.</p>

<p>The interior dimensions are as follows:&mdash;Length,
including a moderately sized chapel at the eastern
extremity, three hundred and fifty English feet;
width, throughout, one hundred and seventy-four
feet; height of the principal nave and transept,
about one hundred and twenty feet. The width
is divided into five naves; those at the outside rising
to about two-thirds of the height of the two next
adjoining; and these to about half that of the centre
nave. An entire side of a chapel opening out of
the southernmost nave, is ornamented in the Arab
style&mdash;having been executed by a Moorish artist at
the same period as the rest; and not (as might be
conjectured) having belonged to the mosque, which<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a>
occupied the same site previously to the erection
of the present cathedral. This small chapel would
be a beautiful specimen of the Arab ornament in
stucco, but for several coats of whitewash it has
received. An arched recess occupies the centre,
and is called the Tomb of the Alguazil. A handsome
doorway in the same style is seen in the anteroom
of the Chapter-saloon.</p>

<span class="caption">APSE OF THE CATHEDRAL, TOLEDO.</span>
</div>

<p>Facing the entrance to the centre or extreme
eastern chapel, that of San Ildefonzo, the back of
the high altar, or, as it is vulgarly called, the Trascoro,<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a>
is&mdash;not adorned, would it were possible not to
say disfigured, by an immense mass of sculpture
called the Transparente. It is not easy to imagine
the reason of this altar-piece having received its
name, for it is not more transparent than any other
mountain&mdash;never was witnessed so lamentable a mis-application
of riches and labour! Some of the marble
was brought from Carrara; the rest is not of a
very good white, and being thus exposed to an
unfavourable contrast, adds to the displeasing effect
of the unwieldy forms which enter into the composition
of this huge blunder of art&mdash;this pile of masses
on masses of ugliness. At the sight of a large
spherical form rising abruptly from the surface of
some shaft of a pillar, you step back, and discover
that it forms part of the posteriors of a corpulent
cherub, as large as the column itself, which he has
thus unmercifully annihilated, in order to save himself
the trouble of passing a few inches to the left
or right. But it is needless to notice the details
of this piece of sculpture, which being the largest,
and occupying the most conspicuous position in the
whole church, forcibly attracts the attention which,
but for that circumstance, one would rather bestow
in another direction.</p>

<p>It is a relief to take one's station on the shining
mahogany benches adjoining the wall of the opposite<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a>
chapel of San Ildefonzo; and to contemplate
its chaste style and graceful proportions, and the
handsome tombs which occupy its octagonally divided
walls. The piece of sculpture in marble,
placed over the principal altar, is undeserving of
its conspicuous situation. It represents the Vision
of San Ildefonzo, to which we shall shortly have
occasion to direct our attention.</p>

<p>The adjoining chapel, as we proceed towards the
northernmost nave, that of Santiago, or more generally
called after its founder, Don Alvaro de Luna,
is still finer. It is larger and loftier, and of a more
ornamental design. It presents five sides of an octagon:
the three remaining sides turning inwards
to suit the form of the apse. This Alvaro de Luna,
the Lord Essex of Juan the Second, having by
the high favour he enjoyed in the intimacy of the
monarch, given umbrage to the courtiers, was put to
death by the King, who gave credit to the charges
falsely brought against him. Don Juan, however, who
did not long survive his friend, had justice done to his
remains. Being found innocent by a posthumous
trial at Valladolid, his body was conveyed with great
pomp to Toledo, and placed in the centre of his
chapel. The tomb of his Countess stands close to
his own; and in the niches of the surrounding walls,
those of his most distinguished relatives, one of whom,<a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a>
on the right of the altar, is represented in complete
armour, with a turban on his head. The treasures
bestowed on this favourite, flowed plentifully into
the Cathedral of Toledo. Besides his chapel, the
finest of all&mdash;the elaborately executed enclosure of
the sanctuary, is one of his gifts: his arms are
there recognised, frequently recurring among the various
designs of the external tracery.</p>

<p>A narrow passage, leading from the apse between
the chapel of Don Alvaro, and the entrance to the
sacristy, communicates with the chapel of the kings.
After passing through a simply designed anteroom
of more recent date, the eye reposes with pleasure
on a small interior in the pointed style of the latest
period&mdash;of proportions, perhaps, not the less graceful
from their being rather narrow for the length.
Two richly ornamented arches, stretching across the
interior, divide it into three parts, in the first of
which is seen a gallery containing an elaborately
wrought gilded confessional. The walls of the two
other divisions are divided into six parts; the chapel
having been constructed and endowed by Juan the
First, for the reception of six monuments: those
of himself and his Queen Isabella; those of his
father Henry the Second, (natural son of Alonzo
the Eleventh, and who dethroned and killed with
his own hand his half-brother, Pedro the cruel,) and<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a>
Doña Juana his wife; and those of Henry the
Third, and Doña Catalina his wife.</p>

<p>Returning to the interior of the apse, and continuing
in the direction of the north side, another
small passage and anteroom lead to the principal
sacristy, which communicates with the next chapel,
called the Sagrario, and composed of three apartments.
The great sacristy contains some good paintings,
particularly the ceiling by Giordano&mdash;a modern
tomb of the late archbishop, Cardinal de Bourbon,
and a series of narrow doors, within which are recesses.
The first of these contains the crown and
bracelets of the Virgin of the Sagrario: in four
others are preserved magnificent ornaments of silver,
representing emblematically the four quarters of the
globe. Each quarter is personified by a figure invested
with the attributes which characterize the
region she represents, seated on a large silver globe,
on the front of which is traced the quarter represented.
The globe is supported by figures of animals.
In the last of these recesses is seen the sword
of Alonzo the Sixth, who won Toledo from the
Moors. It is small, and unornamented, except by a
hilt of embossed silver, on which the arms are repeated
four times. In the smaller sacristy within
are several good pictures, but not so remarkable as
to prevent their being eclipsed by the splendid robe<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a>
of the Virgin of the neighbouring Sagrario, here exhibited,
extended flat on a semicircular board, such
being the form of the garment.</p>

<p>No one knows the value of this treasure. During
the Peninsular War, the archbishop, in order to spare
the French Generals too great a temptation, conveyed
it, together with whatever else deserved the
precaution, to Cadiz. It is embroidered almost entirely
with pearls on a tissue of silver; but none
of the silver is visible without separating the pearls,
diamonds, &amp;c., with the fingers. Most of the larger
pearls possess the irregular sort of beaten shape
often observed in the best specimens. Some are
enormous. Numbers of diamonds, rubies, and other
stones are admitted in the upper part, to vary and
enliven the effect of the different designs of the
embroidery. In another case is extended the front-piece,
worn together with the robe, which is open
in front. The robe sits nearly in the fashion of a
lady's cloak, but perfectly stiff, and widening as it
descends, so much as to make the figure assume the
appearance of a triangle, of which the base is longer
than the two other sides. The opening in front
corresponds with the outline of the two sides, being
wider below than above, although not in as great
a degree. This opening is occupied by the front-piece, which is much smaller than the robe, but<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a>
still more valuable, being principally worked in brilliants.
It contains also every variety of precious
stones, introduced as their colours may happen to accord
with the design.</p>

<p>In addition to these is shown the dress of the
Bambino, similar in materials to the two others; but
the pearls and diamonds more equally distributed.</p>

<p>But the marvel of this costume is the crown. This
ornament adds to the splendour of its materials, the
most exquisite and elaborate workmanship. It would
require hours to appreciate the labour and taste displayed
in all its details. Marshal Soult, could he
but see it, would order masses for the soul of the
prelate who spared him such a temptation. The diamonds,
especially those which compose a cross surmounting
the centre, are of the purest water, and of
immense size. But in the midst of the dazzling and
harmonious intricacy of this gem of all colours, there
is a centre of attraction, which took my fancy more
than the rest. Immediately under the centre ball,
an immense spherical emerald, which supports the
diamond cross, is a small bird suspended on a hook
within the crown. All the parts of this bird
are composed of white enamel, except the body,
around which the wings, legs, neck, and head, are
attached, and which consists of a pearl of an oval
form, about the size of a sparrow's egg. The movement<a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a>
of the statue during a procession, keeps the
bird (hanging from its hook) in constant agitation,
and produces the effect of a living bird enclosed in a
cage of precious stones.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>A pair of bracelets, possessing no less magnificence
than the crown, but rather too heavy and bulky to
be graceful, are suspended in the same recess, and
worn on the same occasions.</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten, as a proof of the judgment
shown in the choice of ornaments, which, as
far as regards the front, consist principally of diamonds,
that the complexion of the Virgin of the
Sagrario, is more than dark&mdash;in fact, quite black.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The innermost of the three apartments forming the
chapel of the Sagrario is called the Ochavo, and is
the deposit of a collection of relics of all kinds. It is
an octagon, surmounted at an elevation of more than
double its diameter by a dome ornamented with
excellent painting. The walls are faced with the
best Spanish marbles. Each of the eight sides contains
an open recess reaching to the first cornice&mdash;an
elevation of about twenty-five feet; and in these
recesses are contained all the valuable relics belonging<a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a>
to the cathedral;&mdash;a rich display of silver statues,
reliquaries, coffins, chests, and crosses of gold and
silver, some containing jewels of great value. A silver
statue of Saint Ferdinand wearing a golden crown
is among the objects most worthy of remark; also
a cross containing a portion of the true cross, presented
to the cathedral by St. Louis. This and
several other relics, such as a phial containing the
Virgin's milk, a portion of our Saviour's purple garment,
&amp;c., were presented to the cathedral by St.
Louis on his return from the east, and are here preserved,
together with the letter in his own hand-writing,
which accompanied them.</p>

<p>The Virgin of the Sagrario receives by far the
greatest share of devotion brought to the numerous
shrines of this vast temple, even greater than that
offered at the high altar. More masses are performed
at her altar than at all the others added
together. The aisles facing her antechapel are
constantly filled with a crowd of kneeling votaries.
She stands in the second enclosure, turning her back
to the Ochavo. An iron railing separates her apartment
from the first chapel, which is usually open
to the aisles. She stands consequently in full view,
magnificently robed in a <i>fac simile</i> imitation of her
pearl dress, the original being only worn on one or
two occasions during the year.<a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a></p>

<p>The interior of the Capilla Mayor, is ornamented
with several rows of statues, and some handsome
funereal monuments, forming together a sort of
transparent wall of sculpture on each of its sides.
In the midst of a series of mitred archbishops, and
coroneted princes, the figure of a peasant occupies
one of the most conspicuous positions. It stands
on the left side, as you face the High Altar, and
about twenty feet from the pavement. This statue
represents a celebrated historical personage. Alonzo
the Eighth, when penetrating across the Sierra Morena
into Andalucia, in search of the Moorish army
under the King of Morocco, Mahomed ben Jacob,
was in danger of losing the fruit of his exertions,
in bringing together the forces of the Kings of Aragon
and Navarre, together with numerous other
confederates. He had led the combined army into
a defile, in which he would have had to receive the
attack of the Moor at an insuperable disadvantage.
The hostile forces occupied a height called the
Puerto del Miradal.</p>

<p>It was at the moment that retreat was the subject
of deliberation, that a peasant presented himself,
and offered to guide the army out of the pass.
Having assured himself of the man's sincerity,
Alonzo put himself under his conduct, and was
led to the summit of the mountain, where he<a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a>
found himself on the border of an immense plain.
This decided the great victory of las Navas de
Tolosa gained over the Moors on the 16th of
July, 1212. Alonzo ordered a statue of the peasant
to be placed in this cathedral. He is represented
in a costume not unlike that of an ancient
Roman rustic, a sort of tunic reaching to the knees,
and his face is covered with a profuse beard.</p>

<p>The interior of the choir is the work of Felipe
de Borgoña, and Berruguete; the latter having been
employed, after the death of Felipe de Borgoña, in
1548, in continuing the sculptures. The entire
south side was left for him to complete; after which
he added a group in marble, representing the Transfiguration,
placed rather injudiciously, since it out-tops
the screen or back of the choir; thus presenting
to the view of those who enter from the
western or grand entrance, and who are more
likely to have come with the intention of viewing
the ornaments, than the canons who are seated in
the choir&mdash;the back of the subject, or rather, forms
which represent no subject whatever. There is a
Virgin on a pedestal in the centre of the eastern
end of the choir, turning her back to the bronze
railing which separates it from the transept. This
statue has occupied its present position ever since
the erection of the cathedral; and it is probable<a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a>
would long since have quitted it, but for a still
greater inconvenience consequent on its removal.
The attempt was recently made, when a mass of
water issued with much violence from beneath the
pedestal, and putting to flight the canons who were
assembled to preside at the operation, instantly
inundated the whole church. The virgin occupies
probably the site of the fountain which must have
been the centre of the court, at the period of the
existence of the mosque. However that may be,
the spot is the exact centre of the present edifice.</p>

<p>At the two eastern angles of the quadrangle,
formed by the intersection of the transept and
principal nave, close to the railing of the capilla
mayor are two pulpits of bronze, excellently
wrought; supported on short pillars of rare marbles.</p>

<span class="caption">INTERIOR OF THE CATHEDRAL, TOLEDO.</span>
</div>

<p>A tall pyramidal Gothic edifice<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of gilded and
painted wood, rising to the full height of the ceiling,
stands in front of a column of the second nave from<a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a>
the north side. All its sides are open, and furnished
with bronze railings, through which is seen an altar,
raised on three or four steps. In the centre of the
altar is inserted a marble slab&mdash;a highly prized relic,
being the stone on which the Virgin placed her foot
on the occasion of her appearing in the cathedral
in <i>propriâ personâ</i> to the Archbishop San Ildefonzo.
This peculiar favour bestowed on the saint&mdash;and a
robe with which she invested him with her own
hands, were bestowed, according to the historian
Mariana, in recompense of his zeal in opposing the
doctrine of the two Frenchmen, Pelagio and Helvidio,
whose writings and preachings tended to shake
the belief in the virginity of the Saviour's mother.
The occurrence is thus described:</p>

<p>"The night immediately preceding the feast of
the Annunciation, the archbishop entered the church,
surrounded by several of the clergy. As they entered,
the cathedral appeared filled with a brilliant
light. Those who accompanied the saint, overcome
with terror, turned and fled. Remaining alone, he
advanced to the foot of the high altar, and fell
on his knees; when, on the chair from which it was
his custom to deliver his exhortations to the people,&mdash;clothed
in more than human majesty&mdash;appeared
the mother of Christ, who addressed him in the
following words:&mdash;'This gift, brought from Heaven,<a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a>
shall be the reward of the virginity which thou hast
preserved in thy body, joined with purity of mind,
and ardour of faith; and for having defended our
virginity.'</p>

<p>"Having thus spoken, she placed on him, with
her own hands, a robe, which she commanded him
to wear on the celebration of her festivals, and
those of her Son."</p>

<p>The representations of this scene, from which is
derived the claim of superior sanctity assumed by
this cathedral, are multiplied both in marble and on
canvas in all parts of the edifice, as well as in almost
all the churches of Toledo. In most cases, the execution
of them has been intrusted to unskilful
hands. The best specimen is that executed in marble
over the small altar I have just noticed. It is remarkable
for the graceful and good-humoured expression
of the Virgin, and the easy, almost merry,
demeanour of her celestial attendants.</p>

<p>The marble box which contains the Host is let
into the altar-piece, of which it appears to form
a part of the surface, only projecting slightly as its
sides are convex. Turning on a pivot, it presents
four different fronts, each representing, in well executed
relief, a different scene in the Virgin's life.<a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a></p>

<p class="r">Toledo.<br />
</p>

<p>One of the first contrasts between this and
other countries, which forces itself on the observation,
is the amalgamation of the different classes
of society in public places of resort. The grandee
is far too sure of his personal importance and consideration,
to entertain any fear of its being
diminished by contact with those of inferior rank;
and the peasant is far too proud to importune
his superiors by any indiscreet efforts at familiarity.</p>

<p>At Burgos I found the <i>Gefe politico</i>, or governor
of the province, sipping his lemonade in the evening
at the <i>café</i>; his elbow brushing the back of a
mayoral of a diligence, and surrounded by an assemblage
of all classes of the male inhabitants of the
town. These cafés are curious establishments; they<a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a>
are divided into two classes&mdash;the Café, properly so
called, and the Botilleria&mdash;in which tea and coffee
are not usually called for, but all the other refreshments
of the café; such as <i>helados</i> (frozen beverages
of all sorts), <i>sorbetes</i> (ices), liqueurs, wines, etc.
These latter are the resort, in some towns, of both
sexes, and indeed the cafés also in a less degree.
But the etiquette in these things differs in the
different provinces.</p>

<p>At Madrid, where foreign customs first penetrate,
ladies are rarely seen in these resorts; by which they
are considerable losers. No doubt, were the attractions
of French cafés sufficiently powerful, your
sex would not have withered them, by their disdain,
into the uncivilized dens which they are. You are
not of course invited by the billiard tables, or by
the allurements of black coffee and cognac; but
were the waiters to set before you a tumbler of
frozen lemonade after a July evening's dusty walk,
you would speedily bring such habits into fashion.</p>

<p>Much as the refreshments of Spanish cafés have
been celebrated, their fame is surpassed by the
reality. It is only when you have panted through a
southern summer's day, and breathed an atmosphere
of fire, that you are disposed to receive the illustration
of the full sense of the word refreshment; and
it is then they hand you a brobdignag goblet, brim<a name="page_145" id="page_145"></a>
full of frozen orange-water or lemonade, or snow-white
orgeat&mdash;which, from the imperceptible inroads
made by the teaspoon on its closing-up surface,
appears likely to last you the whole night. These
and other similar luxuries, including the ices, at
which those of a Grange or Tortoni would melt with
jealousy, are plentiful in second and third-rate
towns, and rank among the necessaries of life, rather
than as objects of indulgence. They are of course
cheap, or it would not answer.</p>

<p>The poor apply to the distributors of iced barley-water,
who carry about a sort of cask, strapped
between their shoulders, and containing ice in the
centre, to maintain the frigidity of the beverage.
By lowering and advancing the left shoulder, the
vendor pours the contents of the cask through a
small neck or pipe into the glasses, which he carries
in a flat basket with cellaret partitions. A tumbler
of this costs a halfpenny; its imbibing occupies two
or three minutes, and assuages for hours the sufferings
of the thirstiest palate.</p>

<p>At Madrid, the cafés have each its political
colour; except that called del Principe, after the
adjoining theatre. In this, politics are less characterised,
literature having here taken up her quarters.
It is probable that she is a less profitable customer,
being habitually less thirsty. Accordingly, on putting<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a>
your head into the door, you see a saloon far
more brilliantly lighted up than the others; but
the peripatetic doctrines seem to prevail. Few persons
are seated at the tables; and instead of the
more profitable wear and tear of broken glasses,
the proprietor probably finds substituted a thankless
annual item for worn out floors. In the same street
there is a club; but this is an exotic importation
and on the exclusive plan, not quite of London, but
of the Paris <i>cercles</i>.</p>

<p>In the cafés of Toledo, on the days of <i>fiesta</i>, the
fair sex predominates, especially in summer. The
great resort is, however, the Zocodover, from nine
to ten in the evening. This little irregularly
formed <i>plaza</i> is crowded like an assembly-room,
and possesses its rows of trees, although a respectable
oak would almost fill it.</p>

<p>A soirée has occasionally been known to be given
in Toledo, but it is an occurrence of much rarity,
and mostly occasioned by some unusual event,&mdash;the
arrival of a public singer, or, still more unusual, a
newly made fortune. The other evening I was
admitted to one, the pretext for which was a wedding.
This ceremony takes place at the residence of the bride,
and although a subsequent formality is necessary in
the Church, its delay does not defer the validity of
the union, nor its consummation. The wedding-day<a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a>
arrived, the families and friends of both parties
assemble at eight in the evening.</p>

<p>The bride was distinguishable by a white veil or
<i>mantilla</i> in the middle seat of a sofa, between her
mother and sister, who rose to receive the guests.
A narrow table had been dressed up into a temporary
altar, and furnished with a crucifix and
candles. All the party being arrived, a priest left
his chair, and entered an adjoining room to robe;
on his reappearance the company rose and flocked
round the bride and bridegroom, who stood together
before the priest, doing penance each with a long
wax-light in the right hand, held in a muslin handkerchief.</p>

<p>The ceremony lasts about ten minutes without any
change of posture. The priest departs to unrobe;
the miserable bride and blushing bridegroom receive
felicitations; and all resume their seats, and look
at each other.</p>

<p>Presently chocolate was handed round, and an
attempt at conversational murmur commenced, afterwards
ices. And now the minister took a formal
leave of the company, after complimenting the
bride. Two or three other holy men, obedient to
the signal, carried out their interminable hats before
them: when a sudden revolution broke out. At
the closing of the door on the hindmost ecclesiastic<a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a>
the bridegroom rushed to the altar, and grasping
with one hand the crucifix, and with the other two
of the candlesticks, ran to the apartment that had
assumed the character of vestry, and deposited them
there, followed by officious friends bearing the remaining
articles, until every awe-compelling symbol
had disappeared. One or two guitars were extracted
from their hiding-places under sofas, and sent forth
careless but lively preludes. The men stood up and
circulated; the women talked and laughed; a
quadrille was speedily formed, and concluded; waltzing
followed, and forfeits, and whatever you like,
and&mdash;"the arrangements were on a scale of costly
magnificence, and the festivities were prolonged, &amp;c."</p>

<p>But these events are rare in Toledo. The every-day
amusements consist in an infamous theatre,
and the promenade; this is only on Saints' days;
but these are almost every day. On six or seven
occasions in the year, these promenades are absolute
events, and much looked forward to. It is necessary
to inquire which is the promenade patronised by
the saint of the great day, whoever he is, and take
your place in the tide, for no one absents himself.</p>

<p>Dresses for these celebrations are things pre-meditated;
and the effect produced, and all the
little events and rencontres of the day form for
each belle, thrilling subjects of retrospection. <i>Mantillas<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a></i>
may be trimmed, and innocent plots woven for
these occasions, without danger of disappointment
by clouds or storms; and instead of the Virgin being
implored that the sun may shine, who never disappoints
them, she is sometimes requested to inspire
some ruse for a momentary escape from his too
searching effulgence.</p>

<p>Here may fair foreigners feast their eyes on fawn-coloured
<i>majos</i>, whose every step (although no more
exalted beings than butchers, postilions, horsedealers,
and such like) would be envied by Antinous and
Apollo. I should advise no veils, nor winkings, nor
blinkings on these occasions, but eyes wide open&mdash;for
never more (the Pyrenees once repassed) will
their orbits expand to the forms and costumes of
blackguards half so beautiful.</p>

<p>But these are subjects slightly unsuited to the
interior of the cathedral, of our presence in which
we are evidently forgetful. The Mozarabic Chapel,
founded by Cardinal Ximenes de Cisneros, is situated
under the southern tower, and contains a Virgin
and Child executed in Mosaic, and a curious
old fresco painting, representing the battle of Oran,
at which the Cardinal was victorious over the Arabs.
This chapel is set apart for the performance of the
Mozarabic ritual, still retained by a portion of the
population of Toledo, and the exercise of which<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a>
was continued in several churches, until the closing
of some of them at the recent revolution.</p>

<p>The Arab conquerors of Spain exercised towards
the religion of the country, the most complete and
liberal tolerance. All who preferred remaining in the
conquered towns to flight and exile, were allowed
to retain a sufficient number of places of worship
for the free exercise of their religion. On the subsequent
introduction of the Italian missal, those
who retained the ancient gothic forms were called
Mozarabes (mixti Arabes, according to some, from
their service being the same as that in use during
the co-existence together of the two creeds). A
more probable origin is attributed to the expression
by some antiquaries, who derive it from Muza,
the name of the Moorish general. The mass of
the Christians who had taken refuge in the Asturias,
applied the term to their brethren, who preferred
accepting from the Arabs what they considered a
degrading tolerance. The following singular mode
of decision was adopted for the purpose of settling
the question between the two missals.</p>

<p>The King, Alonzo the Sixth, the Archbishop Don
Bernardo, and the court, were among the advocates
of the new missal, which, being adopted in Rome,
they were very desirous of establishing on the occasion
of the restoration of the Christian supremacy<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a>
at Toledo. The mass of the people were attached
to their ancient forms. It was resolved that the
question should be decided by an appeal to a sort
of neutral power; and Mars was selected, probably
on account of his being a person disinterested
in the affair. A champion was chosen by each
party, and a day appointed for settling the difference
by single combat. Accordingly, the court,
the clergy, and the people being assembled, the
representatives of the two missals took their station,
lance in rest, and on the appointed signal
spurred to the encounter. The ancient missal was
approved of by the warlike god; but the King
and his party were dissatisfied with the result, and
resolved on another trial. A large fire was lighted
in the principal plaza, and the two missals were
thrown into it.</p>

<p>Again the ancient forms conquered, the rival
parchment having caught the flame and being drawn
out in a blaze. The populace now commenced a
cry of triumph; but, to their great disappointment,
the King, in his quality of umpire, pronounced
a judgment which he might as easily have
put in execution before the trials: namely, that
considering that the Roman Missal, although on
fire, was not consumed, they were both equally
agreeable to the deity&mdash;they should therefore both<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a>
be preserved, and that some of the more ancient
churches should continue the exercise of the Mozarabic
service, while the Roman ritual should be
established in the metropolitan temple, and in the
greater number of the parishes.</p>

<p>Before we leave the cathedral, the cloister claims
our attention. It is a spacious and handsome quadrangle,
inclosing a garden. The eastern wall is
adorned with excellent frescos of comparatively
modern date, and all bearing the same signature&mdash;Francisco
Bayeu. There are seven subjects on
that side, being the number of intervals corresponding
with the arcades, and three more continuing
down another side. The best are two, taken from
the history of Saint Casilda; and three from that
of San Eugenio, first archbishop of Toledo, martyrised
in France. The arcades on the east side
are shut in by large pieces of sail-cloth, in order
to protect the paintings against the sun's rays.</p>

<p>The library of manuscripts belonging to this
cathedral is distinguished rather by the quality than
the quantity of its contents. It is approached by
a staircase communicating with the cloister, and
is a handsome room. It contains a copy of the
Talmud on the papyrus leaves, and in the Coptic
dialect. The following are also among its treasures:
The Book of Esther in Hebrew, on a single piece of<a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a>
parchment; two bibles of the seventh century, one
of which belonged to St. Isidore; the missal used by
Charles the Fifth in the monastery of Yuste; the
poems of Dante, manuscript of the poet's time, with
illustrations; the laws of Alonso the Tenth (surnamed
the wise), and a volume of his poetical works,
with the music opposite those intended to be sung:
two ancient Chinese volumes, one on botany, the
other on natural history, both illustrated.</p>

<p>The next edifice I visited was the Alcazar, the
largest and most conspicuous building in Toledo. I
expected to find there some Arab and Roman remains,
having so read in more than one tour. It was not
until some time after my visit that I obtained the
information that the Moorish palace occupied a
different site. The present comparatively modern
building is principally of two epochs. On the east is
the original portion erected by Alonzo the Sixth. The
entire north and south fronts are probably additions
of Philip the Second. The whole partakes of a
divided character between castle and palace: it is not
remarkable for any architectural merit, possessing
neither beauty as a palace, nor solidity as a fortress;
and having been occupied as a military position during
the war of the succession, and more recently in that
of independence, its being already a ruin, before its
modern appearance would seem to legitimize such<a name="page_154" id="page_154"></a>
a state, causes no surprise. But its position is
superb. Occupying the most elevated point of the
town, it far exceeds the whole by the immense height
of its walls, and commands an admirable view of the
surrounding country. The only object deserving
notice in this ruin is a colossal staircase, which
occupies an entire side of the court,&mdash;a length of
about two hundred and fifty feet,&mdash;and is ornamented
by a light and elegant colonnade. This
edifice ceased to be a palace on the final establishment
of the court at Madrid, and after some time
became the manufactory whence issued the famous
silk and velvet brocades, the fabrication of which has
now ceased, but with which Toledo formerly supplied
the wardrobes of the court, and the well-garnished
sacristies of Spain's wealthiest cathedrals.</p>

<p>Descending from the Alcazar through the Plaza de
Zocodover, and thence towards the bridge of Alcantara,
a few yards from the Plaza bring us in view of
the façade of the Hospital of Santa Cruz, or "de los
niños expositos,"&mdash;foundling hospital. The institution
owes its origin to the Archbishop, Don Pedro
Gonzalez de Mendoza, called the Great Cardinal
of Spain. Although death prevented his witnessing
the execution of his project, his fortune, administered
by his next relatives and executors,&mdash;the
Queen Isabella, and the Duke of Infantado,&mdash;was<a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a>
employed in the erection of the buildings, and in
the endowment of the establishment. The plans
and conditions were not even drawn up until after
the Cardinal's death; and they were never entirely
put in execution. The church consists of one nave, of
a length out of all proportion to its width and elevation.
It was to have been crossed by another of the
same proportions, with the exception of the elevation,
which was to have been eighty feet in both. This
combined with the length&mdash;about three hundred and
fifty feet, as is seen in the existing nave,&mdash;would have
rendered the edifice one of the most extraordinary
in existence. The altar was to have stood in the
centre of the intersection of the two naves. As it
is, the long bare interior looks as though it had been
destined for a picture gallery or library, but rather
for the latter from the low-coved roof of cedar,
and from the inadequate distribution of light. To
the left of the altar is seen a portrait of the founder;
and on the opposite side, about a hundred feet further
down the nave, a large Adoration,&mdash;a superior
painting, especially with regard to the colouring: the
author unknown.</p>

<p>There are two large courts surrounded by arcades:
one of them is a model of lightness and beauty, and
contains in one of its angles an admirably ornamented
staircase. The architect of the Santa Cruz<a name="page_156" id="page_156"></a>
was Enrique Egas, who also built the celebrated
hospital of the same name at Valladolid. He designed
the whole according to the style then introduced,
after the pointed style had been abandoned,
and which in Spain received vulgarly the
appellation of Plateresco, from the ornaments resembling
the embossing of a silversmith. It is also
confounded with the Renacimiento. The Plateresco
style, from the too great liberty it afforded the architect,
of setting aside the classic models, and following
his own inventions, has produced in Spain,
more than in any other country, (from there being at
that period more wealth devoted to the construction
of public monuments there than elsewhere,) the evil
effects resulting from ill-guided and unrestrained
powers of imagination. Fortunately, however, a few
architects existed whose more correct taste kept them
within some bounds; and who, in deserting the old
models, replaced them by a style, if less pure, yet by
no means inelegant. The architect Egas appears to
have partaken of both natures at different moments;
for, while his court above-mentioned is a specimen of
consummate grace and good taste, the entrance front
of the building is one of the bad examples of the
style of the period.</p>

<p>The establishment covers a large space, about half
the extent occupied by the double palace of the<a name="page_157" id="page_157"></a>
Arab kings of Toledo. The remainder of the site
contains two convents,&mdash;that of Santiago, and that
of the Conception. The hospital was conducted
formerly on a scale proportionate to the extent of its
accommodation; but it is now no more than a reminiscence;
the revenues having probably been incorporated
in the recent registrations of national property.
The number of inmates at present enjoying
the benefits of the foundation amounts to fourteen
only.</p>

<p>The Convent of la Conception adjoins the hospital
of Santa Cruz. From the exterior are seen two
churches, placed in close parallel contact, and each
composed of a single nave. Both are evidently
very ancient, one being in the Arab style; but
the form of the other renders it probable that
it is the more ancient of the two. You are disappointed
after being shown this last, on being
informed that the Moorish portion is forbidden
ground, being appropriated by the nuns to
their private use, and possessing no communication
with the adjoining edifice, but a curtained
grating, through which its secluded inmates assist
at religious services. In the public church,
a singular ornament figures on a conspicuous
part of the wall near the entrance; it is the carcass
of a large crocodile, fixed high enough to be<a name="page_158" id="page_158"></a>
out of reach, although no one would be likely to
purloin so unwieldy a curiosity. We are told the
animal frequented the neighbourhood of Toledo;
where, under cover of the pine forests, which formerly
extended far over this mountainous region,
its existence had long filled with terror the few
travellers whom their mercantile pursuits compelled
to pass within its accustomed haunts: that at length
a knight (it was in the reign of Ferdinand and
Isabella) clothed in a full suit of armour, rode forth
from Toledo, fully resolved to try conclusions with
the monster, in order if possible to immortalize his
name throughout the surrounding regions, by ridding
them of so dire a scourge. The battle took place,
and victory declaring for the knight, whose name
unfortunately does not figure in the legend,&mdash;he
assembled the peasants, and had his enemy's carcass
borne in triumph to Toledo, where he made a
present of it to the convent.</p>

<p>While on the subject of traditions, it is worth
while adverting to a cavern, the entrance of which
exists in this part of the town; and which is said to
extend to a distance of eight miles, passing under the
Tagus. It is related that somewhat less than a
century back, the government ordered this cavern
to be explored; but the exploring party was met
at the commencement of the descent by so violent<a name="page_159" id="page_159"></a>
a gust of wind, as to extinguish all the torches,
and the courage of the explorers, for the attempt
was never resumed. The failure by no means contributed
to diminish the mysterious qualities attributed
to the cavern, on the subject of which the
wildest notions are currently entertained.</p>

<p>A worthy and excellent native of Toledo, to whose
antiquarian enthusiasm (a quality doubly valuable
here from its scarcity) I am indebted for some information
and much entertainment, undertook one
day to enlighten me with regard to the origin of this
subterranean curiosity. Commencing by warning
my credulity against the innumerable fables current
on the subject, and which only resembled each other
in their absurdity and impossibility, he added, "The
real fact is this,&mdash;the cavern is the work of Hercules,
who excavated it for the accommodation of the
assemblies of the people, whom he instructed in the
elements of magic."</p>

<p>The convent of Santiago, or of Santa Fé, or of
Las monjas santiagistas, or Las cavalleras, occupies
the portion of the ancient Moorish alcazar, remaining
from the site of the two last-mentioned buildings.
It is built round two courts, one of which is divided
into planted parterres, intersected with brick-paved
walks. The architecture of this first court is very
simple; it consists of a plain arcade of semicircular<a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a>
arches supported on square piers, and a repetition of
the same on the first story. From this court opens
the parlour of the Commendadora or abbess, and the
choir, which forms a continuation of the public
chapel. There is also under the arcade a folding
door, which, when opened exhibits a collection of
small pictures attached to it, as on the leaves of
an album, and others suspended against the portion
of wall it encloses. The centre painting of these
last represents the Mater dolorosa weeping over the
dead body of her Son. It has much of the manner of
Alonzo Cano, and is an admirable painting, more
especially the dead body: the superior, however,
did not know the name of the artist. She complained
bitterly of the loss of a first-rate picture
of the Divino Morales, which formerly occupied the
place of her little collection, and which was taken
possession of by Marshal Soult.</p>

<p>The second court is highly ornamental owing to
the elegance of its architecture, and its magnificent
proportions; it is a long quadrangle; the pillars
below are very lofty, and support the gallery above
without intermediate arches. They are not of a pure
design, the shafts being too long for their diameter:
in other respects they imitate the Tuscan order.
Those of the arcade above are Ionic; but the effect
here is destroyed by walls and windows, which have<a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a>
been constructed in their intervals, for the purpose
of converting the open gallery into a warmer
corridor. The walls below are clothed to the height
of about four feet with the <i>azulejos</i>, or porcelain
mosaic, of the sort originally employed by the Arabs,
and from which the ornament took its name, being
blue and white, without any other colour.</p>

<p>Opening from this court is the Sala Capitular
a handsome saloon used on occasions of elections
of the Commendadora, or other solemnities, which do
not take place in the church. It contains a portrait
of the sister of St. Ferdinand,&mdash;a member of the
community; and a curious picture of St. Iago
leading to victory the christian army of Don Ramiro
the First. In fulfilment of a promise made to the
king the night preceding the battle of Albayde, the
apostle, according to the historians, led the army in
person, mounted on a milk-white charger, which
cantered along at a sufficient elevation over the
heads of the combatants, to be visible to all; thus
inspiring, simultaneously, his <i>protégés</i> with confidence,
and the Moors with terror. From that
victory the Spanish war-cry of Santiago is said to
derive its origin.</p>

<p>The buildings on the north side of the large
court stand on the brink of a perpendicular rock,
overhanging the <i>faubourg</i> on the Madrid side of<a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a>
Toledo, and commanding right and left the luxuriant
<i>vega</i>, to an extent of from forty to fifty miles. Over
the highest story of this portion of the building, and
forming a continuation of the rock, a Belvidere has
been constructed, the roof of which is supported
by piers, leaving all the sides open: it forms a
promenade of about a hundred feet in length, by
twenty-five in width.</p>

<p>The regulations of this convent are much less
strict than those observed by all other religious
communities. It would not otherwise have been
possible to obtain permission to visit the establishment
in detail. The <i>monjas cavalleras</i> (knight-nuns)
of the military order of Santiago, take the
white veil only, and not the black. If a nun inherits
a property, she obtains permission from the council
of military orders, sitting at Madrid, to absent herself
from the convent for the purpose of transacting all
necessary business. The same permission may be
obtained in cases of illness. In taking the vows
there is no prostration beneath the veil. The novice
crosses her hands in a kneeling posture, and takes
the oath on the Gospel. One is struck by something
invincibly puzzling in this amalgamation of military
regulation with religious hierarchy and female
seclusion. They call themselves knights; their
abbess, commander. The king, as Grand Master<a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a>
of the military orders (since Ferdinand the Fifth)
of Calatrava, Alcantara, and Santiago, is their recognised
chief; and whenever military mass is required
to be performed, the troops march into their chapel
to beat of drum.</p>

<p>I was even assured that these recluses are not
obliged to refuse a hand offered for a waltz, if it
belongs to an arm having an epaulette at its other
extremity; and that such scenes are known to occur
in the presence of the commandress herself.</p>

<p>Our party, formed for the visit to this convent,
having been presented to the superior, she gave
directions to a nun to show us every part of the
establishment. This sister, who, we were told,
bore the title and rank of serjeantess (sargenta),
possessed the remains of great beauty, and her
(probably) forty summers had not injured her
commanding and graceful figure. No sooner had
she ushered us into the choir than she left us for an
instant, and returned with her mantle of ceremony,&mdash;the
costume in which they take the vow, and in
which they appear on all occasions of solemnity. It
was with evident satisfaction that she performed this
part of her duties of cicerone; nor was it to be
wondered at. No costume could have been invented
better calculated to set off her natural advantages.
It is composed of a sort of white serge, and appears<a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a>
to have no seam. Attached round the shoulders
it sweeps the ground with a train of four or five
feet. A cross of scarlet cloth, bound with dark
brown edges, and of a graceful form, figures on the
portion which covers the left arm from the shoulder
to the elbow. The white cap, gathered all over into
minute plaits, rises into two parallel ridges, which
passing over to the back of the head, imitate the
form of a helmet. Two large lappets descend to the
shoulders and complete the costume, which is entirely
white, with the exception of the cross. In
walking round the choir to display to us the effect of
this dress, the fair <i>santiagista</i> was a model of majesty
and grace.</p>

<p>To judge from her replies to our questions, it
would appear that the system of softening the
severity of monastic seclusion, and of partial and
occasional communication with the beings of the
outer world, instead of producing more contentment
in the minds of the recluses, may possibly
tend to unsettle them, and render them more dissatisfied
with their lot. When asked how long
she had inhabited the convent, she replied with
an unrestrained and most pathetic inflation of the
chest, more eloquent than the loudest complaint&mdash;"A
very long time; nearly twenty years." The
white mantle, she told us, was an object the sight<a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a>
of which always gave birth to serious reflections;
since it was destined not even to quit her after
death, but to serve also for her shroud.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 391px;">

<img src="images/ill_191_sml.jpg" width="391" height="550" alt="COSTUME OF A MILITARY NUN." title="COSTUME OF A MILITARY NUN." /></a>
<span class="caption">COSTUME OF A MILITARY NUN.</span>
</div>

<p>The nun's choir is entirely separated from the
public chapel, with the exception of two gratings,
which admit to the latter the sound of the organ,
and through which the nuns have a better view of
the church than the public can obtain of the choir,<a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a>
this being less lighted, and on a lower level. Near
the choir a small oratory of no greater dimensions
than about seven feet square, appears to be the only
remains extant of the Arab buildings, which occupied
the site. The ceiling is hemispherical, and ornamented
in the Arab style; and one of the walls
contains a niche surrounded by Arab tracery. I
should mention likewise a fountain in the garden,
which bears a similar character.</p>

<p>These nuns live less in community with each other
than those of other convents; in fact, their life resembles
in many respects that of independent single
ladies. Each inhabits her own suite of apartments,
and keeps her own servant. Her solitary repasts are
prepared in her own separate kitchen, and at the
hour chosen by herself. Once a-year only, on the
occasion of the festival of the patron Apostle, the
community assembles at dinner. The common refectory
is at present let to strangers, together with
other portions of the convent. The novice who
wishes to enter this convent must be of good family,
(proof of noble descent being demanded up to grand-fathers
and grandmothers inclusive) and possessed of
property. Of the entrance of the present <i>commendadora</i>
into the convent thirty years since, a romantic
story is related. She belongs to a family of rank in
the province of La Mancha,&mdash;and it is worth mentioning,<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a>
that she recollects Espartero's father, who,
as she states, served a neighbouring family in the
capacity of cowherd.</p>

<p>A match, <i>de convenance</i>, had been arranged for her
by her parents, on the accomplishment of which they
insisted the more rigidly from her being known to
entertain an attachment, the object of which was
disapproved. No resistance being of any avail, the
wedding-day was named; and she was taken to
Toledo for the purpose of making the necessary purchases
for the occasion. It so happened that she was
received by a relative, a member of the community
of Santiagistas; and whether she confided her pains
to the bosom of this relative, and yielded to her persuasions&mdash;nuns
being usually given to proselytism;
or perhaps acting on the impulse of the moment;
she declared on the morning after her arrival her resolution
never to quit the convent; preferring, as she
resolutely affirmed, an entire life of seclusion, to an
union with a man she detested. Instead, therefore,
of the wedding dresses, a <i>manton capitular</i> was the
only ornament purchased.</p>

<p>The property of this establishment remaining for
the most part in possession of the respective original
possessors, and not forming a common stock, the
conscientious scruples of the revolution made an
exception in its favour, owing to which it is not<a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a>
reduced to so destitute a condition as that of the
other unclosed convents. The nuns of San Clemente&mdash;the
principal convent of Toledo, and of
which the abbess alone possessed private property,
are reduced to a life of much privation, as are also
those of all the other convents. Some obtain presents
in return for objects of manual industry, such
as dolls' chairs, and other similar toys. Those of San
Clemente had, and still have, a reputation for superior
skill in confectionary. A specimen of their
talent, of which I had an opportunity of judging in
the house of a friend of the abbess, appeared to me
to warrant the full extent of their culinary fame.
They do not, however, exercise this art for gain. At
San Clemente, and no doubt at all the others, the
new government&mdash;besides the confiscation of all rents
and possessions in money and land&mdash;seized the provisions
of corn and fruits which they found on
searching the attics of the building.</p>

<p>Immediately below the ruined modern Alcazar,
and facing the Expositos, is seen a vast quadrangular
building, each front of which presents from twenty
to thirty windows on a floor. It is without ornament,
and is entered by a square doorway, which
leads to an interior court. It is now an inn, called
Fonda de la Caridad, but was originally the residence
of the Cid, who built it simultaneously with the<a name="page_169" id="page_169"></a>
erection of the Alcazar, by Alonzo the Sixth, shortly
after the taking of the town; Ruy Diaz being at that
time in high favour, and recently appointed first
Alcalde of Toledo, and governor of the palace. It
was on the occasion of the first cortez held in this
town, that the hero demanded a formal audience of
Alonzo, in which he claimed justice against his two
sons-in-law, the counts of Carrion.</p>

<p>These were two brothers, who had married the
two Countesses of Bivar. On the occasion of the
double marriage, a brilliant party had assembled at
the Cid's residence, where all sorts of festivities had
succeeded each other. The two bridegrooms, finding
themselves, during their presence in this knightly
circle, in positions calculated to test their mettle,
instead of proving themselves, by a display of unequalled
valour and skill, to be worthy of the choice
by which they had been distinguished, gave frequent
proofs of deficiency in both qualities; and, long
before the breaking up of the party, their cowardice
had drawn upon them unequivocal signs of contempt
from many of the company, including even their
host. Obliged to dissimulate their vexation as long
as they remained at the château of the Cid, they
concerted a plan of vengeance to be put in execution
on their departure.</p>

<p>They took formal leave, and departed with their<a name="page_170" id="page_170"></a>
brides for their estate, followed by a brilliant suite.
No sooner, however, had they reached the first town,
than, inventing a pretext, they despatched all the
attendants by a different route, and proceeded on
their journey, only accompanied by their wives. Towards
evening the road brought them to a forest,
which appeared to offer facilities for putting their
project in execution. Here they quitted the highway,
and sought a retired situation.</p>

<p>It happened that an attendant of the Countesses,
surprised at the determination of the party to divide
routes, had been led by curiosity to follow
them unobserved. This follower, after having waited
some time for their return to the high-road, penetrated
into the midst of the wood, in order to discover
the cause of the delay. He found the two
brides lying on the ground, almost without clothing,
and covered with blood, and learned that they
had just been left by their husbands, who had been
scourging them almost to death.</p>

<p>It was against the perpetrators of this outrage
that the Cid pleaded for justice. A certain number
of nobles were selected by Alonzo, and directed to
give a decision after hearing the accusation and the
defence. The offence being proved, the Counts had
nothing to urge in extenuation, and judgment was
pronounced. All the sums of money, treasures,<a name="page_171" id="page_171"></a>
gold and silver vases and goblets, and precious stones,
given by the Cid with his daughters as their dowry,
to be restored; and (at the request of Ruy Diaz)
the two Counts of Carrion, and their uncle, who
had advised them to commit the act, were condemned
to enter the lists against three of the followers
of the Cid. The last decision was momentarily
evaded by the Counts; who urged, that, having
come to Toledo to be present at the cortez,
they were unprovided with the necessary accoutrements.
The King, however, insisted that they
should not escape so mild a punishment, and repaired
himself to Carrion, where he witnessed the
combat, in which, it is needless to add, the culprits
came off second best. The marriages being, at the
same time, declared null, the Cid's daughters were
shortly afterwards married a second time; the eldest,
Doña Elvira, to Don Ramiro, son of Sancho, King
of Navarre; and the younger, Doña Sol, to Don
Pedro, hereditary Prince of Aragon.<a name="page_172" id="page_172"></a></p>

<h3><a name="LETTER_XI" id="LETTER_XI"></a>LETTER XI.</h3>

<h5>STREETS OF TOLEDO. EL AMA DE CASA. MONASTERY OF SAN
JUAN DE LOS REYES. PALACE OF DON HURTADO DE MENDOZA.</h5>

<p class="r">Toledo.<br />
</p>

<p>We will now hasten to the opposite extremity of
the city, where the monastery of San Juan de los
Reyes lays claim to especial interest. But I already
hear you cry for mercy, and exclaim against these
endless convents and monasteries; the staircases,
courts, and corridors of which cause more fatigue
to your imagination, than to the limbs of those who,
however laboriously, explore their infinite details.
Infinite they are, literally, in Toledo; where the
churches, the greater number of which belong to
convents, are not seen, as elsewhere, scattered singly
among the masses of the habitations, but are frequently
to be found in clusters of three or four,
whether united by the same walls, or facing each
other at the two sides of a street. It may, perhaps,
afford you a short relief to pick your way over the<a name="page_173" id="page_173"></a>
somewhat rugged pavement of a few of the Toledo
streets, and take a survey of the exterior town, which
our present destination requires us to traverse in
its entire extent. I must inform you that, for the
success of this enterprise, the stranger stands in
absolute need of a pilot, without whose assistance
his embarrassments would be endless.</p>

<p>Toledo scarcely boasts a street in which two
vehicles could meet and continue their route. Most
are impassable for a single cart; and, in more than
one, I have found it impossible to carry an open
umbrella. Such being the prevailing width of the
streets, their tortuous direction causes a more serious
inconvenience. He who has attempted the task of
Theseus, in the mazes of some modern garden
labyrinth, will comprehend the almost inevitable
consequence of relying on his own wits for finding
his way about Toledo,&mdash;namely, the discovery
that he has returned to his point of departure at
the moment he imagined that half the town separated
him from it. This result is the more favoured
by the similarity of the streets and houses.
No such thing as a land-mark. All the convents
are alike. You recollect at a particular turning,
having observed a Moorish tower; consequently,
at the end of the day, the sight of the Moorish
tower leads you on, buoyed up by doubly elevated<a name="page_174" id="page_174"></a>
spirits, in the required direction, most anxious to
bring the tiring excursion to a close: but this tower
leads you to the opposite extremity of the city to
that you seek, for there are half a dozen Moorish
towers, all alike, or with but a trifling difference
in their construction.</p>

<p>Nor is this obstacle to solitary exploration unaccompanied
by another inconvenience. I allude to
the continual ascents and descents. The surface of
the mountain on which Toledo is built, appears to
have been ploughed by a hundred earthquakes, so
cut and hacked is it, to the exclusion of the smallest
extent of level ground. To carry a railroad across
it, would require an uninterrupted succession of
alternate viaducts and tunnels. In consequence of
this peculiarity, the losing one's way occasions
much fatigue. To do justice to the inhabitants,
an almost universal cleanliness pervades the town,&mdash;an
excellence the attainment of which is not easy
in a city so constructed, and which gives a favourable
impression of the population. It is one of the
towns in which is proved the possibility of carrying
on a successful war against the vermin for which
the Peninsula has acquired so bad a reputation, by
means of cleanliness maintained in the houses.</p>

<p>In the house I inhabited on my arrival, I had
suspected for some days an unusual neglect in the<a name="page_175" id="page_175"></a>
duties of the housemaid, to whose department it
belonged to sweep the <i>esteras</i> or matting, which
serve for carpets, from the circumstance of my
having been visited by one or two unwelcome tormentors.
I ventured a gentle remonstrance to the
<i>ama</i> (landlady), stating my reasons for the suspicion
I entertained. It happened that on the previous
day I had mentioned my having been shown over
the Archbishop's palace. This she had not forgotten;
for with a superb coolness, scarcely to be
met with out of Spain, she replied, "Fleas! oh, no!
sir! we have none here,&mdash;you must have brought
them with you from the Palace." Satisfied, however,
with having maintained her dignity of landlady,
she took care to have the nuisance removed.</p>

<p>This <i>ama</i>, as may be already judged, was a curiosity.
In the first place, she was a dwarf. The
Spaniards are not, generally speaking, a more diminutive
race than the other inhabitants of Southern
Europe: but when a Spaniard, especially a woman,
takes it into her head to be small, they go beyond
other nations. Nowhere are seen such prodigies of
exiguity. The lady was, moreover, deformed, one of
her legs describing a triangle, which compelled her
in walking to imitate the sidelong progress of a crab.
Possessed of these peculiarities she had attained, as
spinster, that very uncertain age called by some<a name="page_176" id="page_176"></a>
"certain," but agreed by all to be nearer the end
than the commencement of life.</p>

<p>Although not an exception, with regard to temper,
to the generality of those whose fate it is to endure
such a complication of ills, she nevertheless on
frequent occasions gave way to much amiability,
and especially to much volubility of discourse. She
was not without a tinge of sentimentality; and when
seated, fan in hand, and the <i>mantilla puesta</i>, on
one of the chairs shorn of almost their entire legs,
which were to be found in all parts of the house,&mdash;she
made by no means a bad half-length representation
of a fine lady.</p>

<p>She had apparently experienced some of the
sorrows and disappointments incident to humanity;
and on such occasions had frequently, no doubt,
formed the resolution of increasing, although in
a trifling degree, some religious sisterhood, of which
establishments she had so plentiful a choice in her
native city; but, whether on a nearer approach,
she had considered the veil an unbecoming costume,
or her resolution had failed her on the brink of
the living tomb, the project had not as yet taken
effect. The turn, however, thus given to her reflections
and inquiries, had perfected in her a branch
of knowledge highly useful to strangers who might
be thrown in her way. She was a limping encyclopedia<a name="page_177" id="page_177"></a>
of the convents and monasteries of Toledo;
and could announce each morning, with the precision
of an almanack, the name of the saint of the day,&mdash;in
what church or convent he was especially fêted,
and at what hour the ceremony would take place.
She was likewise <i>au fait</i> of the foundation, ancient
and modern annals, and peculiarities of every sort
which belong to every religious establishment of the
many scores existing in Toledo. Her administration
of the household affairs was admirably organized
owing to her energetic activity. Her love of cleanliness
would frequently induce her to take the sweeping
department into her own hands&mdash;a circumstance
which was sure to render the operation doubly successful,
for the brooms, which in Toledo are not
provided with handles or broomsticks, were exactly
of a length suited to her stature. Before we take
leave of her, here is one more of her original replies.</p>

<p>I complained to her at breakfast that the eggs
were not as fresh as usual; and, suiting the action
to the word, approached the egg-cup containing the
opened one so near to her, that the organs of sight
and smell could not but testify to the justice of my
<i>reclamation</i>. Shrugging her shoulders, until they
almost reached the level of the table&mdash;and with
much contempt depicted on her countenance: "How
could it be otherwise?" she exclaimed, "the egg<a name="page_178" id="page_178"></a>
was taken a quarter of an hour ago from under
the hen; but you have broken it at the wrong end."</p>

<p>The monastery called San Juan de los Reyes, was
founded by Ferdinand and Isabella, on their return
from the conquest of Granada, and given to a fraternity
of Franciscan friars. An inscription to this
effect in gothic characters runs round the cloister
walls, where it forms a sort of frieze, in a line with
the capitals of the semi-columns. The inhabited
part of the establishment is in a state of complete
ruin, having been destroyed by the French during
the Peninsular War. The cloisters are, likewise, in
a semi-ruinous state: the part best preserved being
the church; although that was not entirely spared,
as may be supposed from its having been used as
cavalry stables.</p>

<p>The choice of a situation for the erection of this
convent was perfect in the then flourishing state
of Toledo; and, even now, its picturesque position
lends a charm to the melancholy and deserted remains
still visible of its grandeur and beauty. It
stands on the brow of the cliff, commanding the
termination of the chasm already described as
commencing at the bridge of Alcantara. It commands,
therefore, the ruins of Roderick's palace,
placed a few hundred yards further on, and on a
lower level; still lower the picturesque bridge of<a name="page_179" id="page_179"></a>
St. Martin, striding to the opposite cliff, over arches
of ninety feet elevation, and the lovely <i>vega</i> which
stretches to the west.</p>

<span class="caption">CHURCH OF SAN JUAN DE LOS REYES.</span>
</div>

<p>This monastery was one of the most favoured
amongst the numerous royal endowments of that
period. It is said that its foundation was the result
of a vow pronounced by Ferdinand and the Queen<a name="page_180" id="page_180"></a>
before the taking of Granada. In addition to the scale
of magnificence adopted throughout the entire plan,
the royal founders, on its completion, bestowed a
highly venerated donation&mdash;the collection of chains
taken from the limbs of the Christian captives, rescued
by them from the dungeons of the Alhambra.
They are suspended on the outside walls of the two
sides of the north-eastern angle of the church, and
are made to form a frieze, being placed in couples
crossing each other at an acute angle; while those
that remained are suspended vertically in rows by
fours or fives, in the intervals of the pilastres.</p>

<p>The interior of the church is still sufficiently
entire to give some idea of its original splendour.
Its dimensions are rather more than two hundred
feet in length, by eighty in width, and as many in
height&mdash;excepting over the intersection of the nave
and transept, where the ceiling rises to a hundred
and eight feet. These dimensions are exclusive of
three recesses on either side, forming chapels open
to the nave, there being no lateral naves or aisles.
The style of the whole is very ornamental; but the
east end is adorned with an unusual profusion of
sculpture. The transept is separated from the eastern
extremity of the building, by a space no greater
than would suffice for one of the arches; and its
ends form the lines, which being prolonged, constitute<a name="page_181" id="page_181"></a>
the backs of the chapels. The royal arms,
supported by spread eagles, are repeated five times
on each end-wall; separated respectively by statues
of saints in their niches, and surmounted by a profusion
of rich tracery. These subjects entirely cover
the walls to a height of about forty feet, at which
elevation another inscription in honour of the
founders runs round the whole interior. The transepts
not being formed by open arches, the sides
afford space for a repetition of the same ornament,
until at their junction with the nave they are terminated
by two half-piers covered with tracery, and
surmounted by semi-octagonal balconies, beneath
which the initials of Ferdinand and Isabella, made
to assume a fancy shape, and surmounted by coronets,
are introduced with singularly graceful effect.</p>

<p>But the chief attraction of this ruin is the cloister.
A small quadrangle is surrounded by an ogival or
pointed arcade, enriched with all the ornament that
style is capable of receiving. It encloses a garden,
which, seen through the airy-web of the surrounding
tracery, must have produced in this sunny region
a charming effect. At present, one side being
in ruins and unroofed, its communication with the
other three has been interrupted; and, whether or
not in the idea of preserving the other sides from
the infection, their arches have been closed nearly<a name="page_182" id="page_182"></a>
to the top by thin plaister walls. Whatever may have
been the motive of this arrangement, it answers
the useful purpose of concealing from the view a
gallery which surmounts the cloister, the arches of
which would neutralize the souvenirs created by the
rest of the scene, since they announce a far different
epoch of art, by the grievous backsliding of
taste evinced in their angular form and uncouth
proportions.</p>

<span class="caption">CLOISTER OF SAN JUAN DE LOS REYES, TOLEDO.</span>
</div><p><a name="page_183" id="page_183"></a></p>

<p>Until the destruction of the monastery by the
French, the number of monks was very considerable;
and in consequence of the unusual privileges accorded
to their body, had become the objects of
especial veneration. A curious proof of this still
exists in the form of a printed paper, pasted on one
of the doors in the interior of the church, and no
doubt preserved carefully by the fifteen or sixteen
brothers, who continued after the dispersion of the
rest to inhabit the few apartments, which, by their
situation over the cloister, had escaped the flames;
and who were only finally compelled to evacuate
their retreat on the occasion of the general convent
crusade of the late revolution. It is an announcement
of indulgences, of which the following is the
opening paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indulgence and days of pardon to be gained by
kissing the robe of the brothers of San Francisco.</p>

<p>"All the faithful gain, for each time that they
kiss the aforesaid holy robe with devotion of heart,
two thousand and seventy-five days of Indulgence.
Further than this, whosoever of the faithful shall
kiss the aforesaid holy robe devoutly, gains each time
eight thousand one hundred days of pardon. The
which urges to the exercise of this devotion the
Princes, Kings, Emperors, Bishops, and highest dignitaries
of the Church, and the monks of other religious<a name="page_184" id="page_184"></a>
orders; and even those of the same order
gain the same, according to the doctrine of Lantusca,
who writes, 'Videant religiosi quantum thesaurum
portent secum.' Since those who with hearts
filled with lowliness and love, bend the knees to kiss
the precious garment, which opens to so many souls
the entrance to Heaven, leading them aside from
the paths of perdition, with trembling and terror
of the entire hosts of hell, are doubtless those who
gain the above-mentioned Indulgences, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Cardinal Ximenes had assumed the habit of this
monastery before his nomination to the see of Toledo.</p>

<p>Among the numerous relics of the ancient prosperity
of this ruinous corner of Toledo, are seen the
walls of the palace of Don Juan Hurtado de Mendoza.
To them were confided the secret murmurings
of Charles the Fifth's vexation, when, elated
with his Italian successes&mdash;lord of the greatest empire
of Christendom, and flattered by the magnificent
hospitality of the Genoese, he only resorted
hither to be bearded by his Spanish vassals, and to
hear his request for supplies unceremoniously refused.
Although monarch of nearly half Europe,
and, better still, of Mexico and Peru, that sovereign
appears to have undergone the torments of a constantly
defective exchequer.<a name="page_185" id="page_185"></a></p>

<p>His armies were not numerous for such an empire,
and yet they were frequently in revolt for
arrears of pay. Could at that time the inventor of
a constitution on the modern principle have presented
himself to Charles, with what treasures would
he not have rewarded him? On his arrival in Spain,
in the autumn of 1538, the emperor convoked the
cortez in Toledo, "for the purpose of deliberation
on the most grave and urgent causes, which obliged
him to request of his faithful vassals an inconsiderable
contribution, and of receiving the assurance
of the desire with which he was animated, of diminishing
their burdens as soon as circumstances
should enable him to do so." All assembled on the
appointed day&mdash;the prelates, the grandees, the
knights, the deputies of cities and towns. The
opening session took place in the great salon of the
house of Don Juan Hurtado de Mendoza, Count
of Melita, in which the emperor had taken up his
abode; and two apartments in the convent of San
Juan de los Reyes, were prepared for the remaining
meetings&mdash;one for the ecclesiastical body, presided
by the Cardinal de Tavera, archbishop of Toledo,
accompanied by Fray Garcia de Loaysa, cardinal,
and confessor of the emperor, afterwards Archbishop
of Seville&mdash;the other for the lay members of the
cortez.<a name="page_186" id="page_186"></a></p>

<p>Although an adept at dissimulation, what must
have been the impatience of Charles, while under
the necessity of listening, day after day, to reports
of speeches pronounced by the independent members
of his <i>junta</i> on the subject of his unwelcome
proposition, without the consolation of foreseeing
that the supplies would eventually be forthcoming.
The orators did not spare him. The historian,
Mariana, gives at full length the speech of
the condestable Don Velasco, Duke of Frias, a
grandee enjoying one of the highest dignities at
the court, who commences by declaring that, "with
respect to the Sisa," (tax on provisions, forming the
principal subject of the emperor's demand,) "each
of their lordships, being such persons as they were,
would understand better than himself this business:
but what he understood respecting it was, that
nothing could be more contrary to God's service,
and that of his Majesty, and to the good of these
kingdoms of Castile, of which they were natives, and
to their honour, than the Sisa;" and, further on, proposes
that a request be made to his Majesty, that
he would moderate his expenditure, which was
greater than that of the Catholic kings.</p>

<p>On an address to this effect being presented to
the emperor, he replied, that "he thanked them
for their kind intentions; but that his request was<a name="page_187" id="page_187"></a>
for present aid, and not for advice respecting the
future:" and finding, at length, that no Sisa was
to be obtained, he ordered the archbishop to dissolve
the <i>junta</i>, which he did in the following
words:&mdash;"Gentlemen,&mdash;his Majesty says, that he
convoked your lordships' assembly for the purpose
of communicating to you his necessities, and those of
these kingdoms, since it appeared to him that, as they
were general, such also should be the remedy; but
seeing all that has been done, it appears to him
that there is no need of detaining your lordships,
but that each of you may go to his house, or whither
he may think proper."</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the grandees, who had
on this occasion complained of Charles's foreign
expeditions, and neglect of his Spanish dominions,
did not pursue the system best calculated to reconcile
him to a residence among them. Instead of
taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by
social intercourse, for making amends for the repulse
he had suffered from the cortez, they appeared desirous
of rendering the amount of humiliation which
awaited him in Spain a counterpoise to his triumphs
in his other dominions. On the close of the above-mentioned
session, a tournament was celebrated in
the <i>vega</i> of Toledo. On arriving at the lists, an
<i>alguacil</i> of the court, whose duty it was to clear the<a name="page_188" id="page_188"></a>
way on the emperor's approach&mdash;seeing the Duke
de l'Infantado in the way, requested him to move
on, and on his refusal struck his horse with his
staff. The duke drew his sword and cut open the
officer's head. In the midst of the disturbance
occasioned by the incident, the <i>alcalde</i> Ronquillo
came up, and attempted to arrest the duke in the
emperor's name&mdash;when the constable, Duke de
Frias, who had just ridden to the scene of bustle,
reining in his horse, exclaimed, "I, in virtue of
my office, am chief minister of justice in these kingdoms,
and the duke is, therefore, my prisoner;" and
addressing himself to the alcalde: "know better
another time, on what persons you may presume
to exercise your authority." The duke left the
ground in company of the last speaker, and was followed
by all the nobles present, leaving the emperor
entirely unaccompanied. It appears that no
notice was taken by Charles of this insult; his manner
towards the Duke of Infantado on the following
day being marked by peculiar condescension, and
all compensation to the wounded <i>alguacil</i> left to
the duke's generosity.</p>

<p>The personal qualities of this prince, as a monarch,
appear to have been overrated in some degree in his
own day; but far more so by subsequent writers.
The brilliancy of his reign, and the homage which<a name="page_189" id="page_189"></a>
surrounded his person were due to the immense
extent of his dominions; and would never have belonged
to him, any more than the states of which
he was in possession, had their attainment depended
in any degree on the exercise of his individual
energies. When in the prime of youth, possessed
of repeated opportunities of distinguishing himself
at the head of his armies, he kept aloof, leaving the
entire conduct of the war to his generals. His
rival, Francis the First, wounded at Pavia in endeavouring
to rally his flying troops, and at length
taken prisoner while half crushed beneath his dead
horse, was greater&mdash;as he stood before the hostile
general, his tall figure covered with earth and blood&mdash;than
the absent emperor, who was waiting at
Valladolid for the news of the war.</p>

<p>Nor were the qualities of the statesman more conspicuous
than those of the warrior on this occasion.
Having received the intelligence of his victory, and
of the capture of his illustrious prisoner, he took
no measures&mdash;gave no orders. To his general every
thing was left; and when the captive King was,
at his own request, conveyed some time after to
Spain, the astonished emperor had received no previous
notice of his coming. He allowed himself to
be out-man&#339;uvred in the treaty for the liberation
of his prisoner; and when Francis broke the pledge<a name="page_190" id="page_190"></a>
he had given for the restitution of Burgundy, he
took no steps to enforce the execution of the stipulations;
and he ultimately gave up the two French
princes, who remained in his power as hostages, in
return for a sum of money.</p>

<p>Far from maintaining the superiority in European
councils due to his extensive dominions, the Italian
republics were only prevented with the greatest
difficulty, and by the continual presence of armies,
from repeatedly declaring for France: and even the
popes, to whom he paid continual court, manifested
the small estimation in which they held his influence
by constantly deserting his cause in favour of
Francis,&mdash;the cause of the champion of Christianity
in favour of the ally of the Infidel, and <i>that</i> frequently
in defiance of good faith; shewing how
little they feared the consequences of the imperial
displeasure.</p>

<p>If these facts fail in affording testimony to his
energy and capacity, still less does his character
shine in consistency. He professed an unceasing
ardour in the cause of Christianity; offering to the
French king the renunciation of his rights, and
a release from that monarch's obligations to him,
on condition of his joining him in an expedition
against the Infidels; but when he found himself
at the head of an immense army under the walls of<a name="page_191" id="page_191"></a>
Vienna, he sat still and allowed Solyman to carry off
at his leisure the spoils of the principal towns of
Hungary.</p>

<p>When at length he made up his mind to take
the field, he selected, as most worthy of the exercise
of his prowess, the triumph over the pirate Barbarossa
and his African hordes: the most important
result of the campaign being the occupation of
Tunis, (where in his zealous burnings for Christianity
he installed a Mahometan sovereign,) and the
wanton destruction by his soldiers of a splendid
library of valuable manuscripts.</p>

<p>We have seen how little his Spanish subjects
allowed themselves to be dazzled by the splendours
of his vast authority, and history informs us how far
he was from conceiving the resolution of reducing
them to obedience by any measures savouring of
energetic demonstration. The irreverence to his
person he calmly pocketed, and the deficiences in
his exchequer were supplied by means of redoubled
pressure on his less refractory Flemings. He submitted
to the breach of faith of Francis of France,
and to the disrespect of his Castilian vassals; but,
on the burghers of the city of Ghent being heard to
give utterance to expressions of discontent at the
immoderate liberties taken with their purse-strings,
he quits Madrid in a towering rage, crosses France at<a name="page_192" id="page_192"></a>
the risk of his liberty, and enters his helpless burg
at the head of a German army, darting on all
sides frowns of imperial wrath, each prophetic of a
bloody execution.</p>

<p>Aware of the preparations of Francis for attacking
his dominions simultaneously in three different
directions, he took insufficient or rather no measures
to oppose him, but turning his back, embarked for
Algiers, where he believed laurels to be as cheap as
at Tunis. There, however, he lost one half of his
armament, destroyed by the elements; and the
remainder narrowly escaping a similar fate, and
being dispersed in all directions, he returned in
time to witness the unopposed execution of the
plans of his French enemy. What measures are his
on such an emergency? Does he call together the
contingents of the German States? Unite the different
corps serving in Lombardy and Savoy,&mdash;dispatch
an order to the viceroy of Naples to march for the
north of Italy; and having completed his combinations,
cross the Pyrenees at the head of a Spanish
army, and give the law to his far weaker antagonist?
No! nothing that could lead to an encounter with
the French king accorded with his policy, as it has
been called, but more probably with his disposition.
He quits Spain, it is true, and using all diligence,
travels round France, but not too near it, and arrives<a name="page_193" id="page_193"></a>
in Flanders. Here he puts himself at the head of
his Germans, and marches&mdash;against the Duke of
Cleves! who had formed an alliance with his
principal enemy.</p>

<p>Seeing the emperor thus engaged, Francis completes
a successful campaign, taking possession of
Luxembourg and other towns. At length the
sovereign of half Europe, having received news of
the landing of an English army in Picardy, resolves
to venture a demonstration against France. He
therefore traverses Lorraine at the head of eighty
thousand troops, and makes himself master of Luneville:
after which, hearing that Francis had despatched
his best troops to oppose Henry the Eighth,
and was waiting for himself, as the less dangerous
foe, with an army of half the strength of his own,
and composed of recruits, he makes up his mind to
advance in the direction of Paris. After a fortnight's
march he finds himself in presence of the French
king, to whom he sends <i>proposals of peace</i>!</p>

<p>These being rejected, he continues his march;
when a messenger from Francis announces his consent
to treat. Under these circumstances, does he
require the cession of Burgundy, according to the
terms of the unexecuted treaty of Madrid? Does
he even stipulate for any advantage, for any equality?
No! he agrees, on the contrary, to cede Flanders<a name="page_194" id="page_194"></a>
to the French, under colour of a dowry with his
daughter the Infanta Maria, who was to be married
to the Duke of Orleans; or else Milan, with his
niece the daughter of the King of the Romans; and
he beats a retreat with his immense army, as if
taking the benefit of a capitulation.</p>

<p>There is something in the result of this French
campaign which appears to explain much of
Charles's previous conduct; and shows that in
many instances he was actuated by personal fear
of his gallant rival. On this occasion he did not
hesitate to desert the King of England, who had no
doubt calculated on his coöperation, as much as
Charles had depended on the diversion created by
the British army. The more one reflects on the
passages of this emperor's history, the less one is
surprised at his resolution to abdicate. He gave
in this a proof of his appreciation of his real
character, which undoubtedly fitted him rather
for a life of ease and retirement, than for the arduous
duties of supreme power.<a name="page_195" id="page_195"></a></p>

<h5>ARAB MONUMENTS. PICTURES. THE PRINCESS GALIANA.
ENVIRONS.</h5>

<p class="r">Toledo.<br />
</p>

<p>Returning along the edge of the cliff, a very
short space separates the extreme walls of the ruined
monastery of Ferdinand and Isabella, from an edifice
of much greater antiquity, although not yet a ruin.
Its exterior as you approach, is more than simple.
It is not even a neatly constructed building;
but such a pile of rough looking mud and stone,
as, on the continent, announces sometimes a barn,
or granary of a farming establishment <i>mal monté.</i>
A high central portion runs from end to end, from
either side of which, at about four-fifths of its height,
project lower roofs of brownish-red tiles. The old
square rotten door is in exact keeping with all
this exterior, and contributes its share to the surprise
experienced on entering, when you discover,
on a level with the eye, distributed over a spacious<a name="page_196" id="page_196"></a>
quadrangular area, a forest of elaborately carved capitals,
surmounting octagon-shaped pillars, and supporting
innumerable horse-shoe arches, scattered
in apparent confusion. All these as you advance
down a flight of steps, fall into rank, and you
speedily find yourself in the centre of an oriental
temple in all its symmetry.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 550px;">

<span class="caption">INTERIOR OF SANTA MARIA LA BLANCA, TOLEDO.</span>
</div>

<p>The principal light entering from the western
extremity, you do not at first perceive that three
of the five naves terminate at the opposite end, by<a name="page_197" id="page_197"></a>
half domes of more modern invention. These have
since been almost built out, and do not form a part
of the general view,&mdash;not in consequence of a decree
of a committee of fine arts, but for the convenience
of the intendant of the province, who selected
the edifice, as long as it remained sufficiently
weather-proof for such a purpose, for a magazine
of government stores. There is no record of the
antiquity of this church, supposed to be the most
ancient in Toledo: at all events, it is the most ancient
of those constructed by the Arabs. It was
originally a synagogue, and received the above mentioned
half cupolas on its conversion to a Catholic
church; since which period it has been known
by its present title of Santa Maria la Blanca.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards further on, following the
same direction, is the church called the Transito,
also in the oriental style, but on a different plan:
a large quadrangular room, from about ninety to a
hundred feet in length, by forty in width, and about
seventy high, without arches or columns, ornamented
with Arab tracery in stucco, on the upper part
of the walls, and by a handsome cedar roof. A
cement of a different colour from the rest runs round
the lowest portion of the walls, up to about breast
high; no doubt filling the space formerly occupied
by the azulejos. Some remains of these still decorate<a name="page_198" id="page_198"></a>
the seats, which are attached to the walls at
the two sides of the altar. The building is in excellent
preservation, and until lately was used as
a church of the Mozarabic sect. The ornaments
are remarkable for the exquisite beauty of their
design, and are uninjured, excepting by the eternal
whitewash, the monomania of modern Spanish decorators.</p>

<p>The Jews were the primitive occupants of this
elegant temple also. Samuel Levi, treasurer and
favourite of Pedro the Cruel (who subsequently
transferred his affection from the person of his
faithful servant to the enormous wealth, amassed
under so indulgent a prince, and seized a pretext
for ordering his execution) was the founder of this
synagogue. The inauguration was accompanied by
extraordinary pomp. The treasurer being, from
his paramount position at the court of Castile, the
most influential personage of his tribe, the leading
members of Judaism flocked from all parts of Europe
to Toledo to be present on the occasion, and a
deputation from Jerusalem brought earth of the
Holy Land, which was laid down throughout the
whole interior before the placing of the pavement.</p>

<p>A very different origin, more suited to believers
in miracles, is attributed to this church by the
present titular sacristan. This Quasimodo of the<a name="page_199" id="page_199"></a>
fabric, a simple and worthy functionary, enjoys a
sinecure, except, it is to be feared, with regard to
salary. Although, however, no duties confine him
to his post, his attachment to the edifice prevents
his ever being found further from it than the porch;
under the cool shelter of which, as he leans against
the wall, he fabricates and consumes the friendly
<i>cigarito</i>. When questioned with an appearance of
interest on the subject of the building, he replies
with unrestrained delight. Its foundation he attributes
to Noah, fixing the date at seventeen
hundred years back; but without adding any particulars
relative to this miraculous visit paid to
Toledo, by the ghost of the patriarch.</p>

<p>As is the case with all other ecclesiastical edifices
closed pursuant to the recent decrees, this
building may become the property of any one,
who would offer a sufficient price, not according
to the real value, but to that to which such objects
are reduced by the great number in the market.
Several other churches are simply closed and
left unguarded; but the antiquarian sacristan above
mentioned, is placed here on account of the existence
of a room in which are contained the archives
of the knights of Calatrava and Alcantara, until
recently its proprietors. No reparations, however,
are ordered; and there is many an enthusiast in<a name="page_200" id="page_200"></a>
archæological research who, should such an edifice
fall under his notice, would, no doubt, rescue
it from its now imminent fate. It is not only a
monument admirable for the details of the ornaments,
the best of its sort to be met with north
of Andalucia, but it forms a valuable link in the
chain of architectural history. It is the first ecclesiastical
edifice of its style recorded as having
set the example of an open area, destitute of columns
and arcades.</p>

<p>At the distance of a few hundred yards from this
building, a portion of the precipice is pointed out,
to which was given in former times the name of
the Tarpeian rock. It was the spot selected by
the Jewish authorities, (who enjoyed in Toledo,
under the Kings of Castile, the right of separate
jurisdiction in their tribe,) for the execution of their
criminals. It is a perpendicular rock, but with
an intermediate sloping space between its base and
the Tagus.</p>

<p>One of the most curious of the Arab monuments
of Toledo, is the church called the Christo de la
Luz, formerly a mosque. It is extremely small;
a square of about twenty feet; and is divided by
four pillars into three naves, connected with each
other, and with the surrounding walls, by twelve
arches. This disposition produces in the ceiling<a name="page_201" id="page_201"></a>
nine square compartments, which rise each to a
considerable height, enclosed by walls from the
tops of the arches upwards. Each small square
ceiling is coved and ornamented with high angular
ribs, rising from the cornice and intersecting
each other, so as to form a different combination
in each of the nine.</p>

<span class="caption">INTERIOR OF CHRISTO DE LA LUZ. TOLEDO.</span>
</div>

<p>The principal remaining Arab buildings are, the<a name="page_202" id="page_202"></a>
beautiful gate called Puerta del Sol; part of the
town walls with their towers; the parochial church
of San Roman; the tower of the church of St.
Thomas; and two or three other similar towers.
Several private houses contain single rooms of the
same architecture, more or less ornamental. The
most considerable of these is situated opposite the
church of San Roman, and belongs to a family residing
at Talavera. They have quitted the house in
Toledo, which is in a ruinous state. The Moorish
saloon is a fine room of about sixty feet in length
by upwards of forty high, and beautifully ornamented.
The Artesonado roof of cedar lets in already, in
more than one part, light and water; and half the
remainder of the house has fallen.</p>

<p>The good pictures in Toledo are not very plentiful.
It is said some of the convents possessed good
collections, which were seized, together with all
their other property. Many of these are to be
seen in the gallery called the Museo Nacional, at
Madrid. Others have been sold. Those of the
cathedral have not been removed; but they are not
numerous: among them is a St. Francisco, by Zurbaran;
and a still more beautiful work of Alonzo
del Arco, a St. Joseph bearing the Infant. It is
in a marble frame fixed in the wall, and too high
to be properly viewed: but the superiority of the<a name="page_203" id="page_203"></a>
colouring can be appreciated, and the excellence
of the head of the saint. In the smaller sacristy
are two pictures in Bassano's style, and some copies
from Raphael, Rubens, and others. At the head
of the great sacristy, there is a large work of Domenico
Theotocopuli, commonly called El Greco,
(the head of the school of Toledo) which I prefer
much to the famous Funeral of the Count Orgaz,
in the church of Santo Tonie, which, according to
some, passes for his masterpiece. In the first are
traits of drawing, which forcibly call to mind the
style of the best masters of the Roman school,
and prove the obligation he was under to the instructions
of his master Michel Angelo. The subject
is the Calvary. The soldiery fill the back
ground. On the right hand the foreground is occupied
by an executioner preparing the cross, and
on the left, by the group of females. The erect
figure of the Christ is the principal object, and
occupies the centre, somewhat removed from the
front. This is certainly a fine picture; the composition
is good, and the drawing admirable, but
the colouring of the Greco is always unpleasing.</p>

<p>In the Funeral of Count Orgaz it is insufferably
false; nor, in fact, is it easy to conjecture to what
sort of merit this picture owes its celebrity. It
possesses neither that of conception, nor that of<a name="page_204" id="page_204"></a>
composition, nor of expression: least of all that of
colouring. All that can be said in its favour is,
that the row of heads extending from one end of
the canvass to the other, across the centre, are correct
portraits of personages of note, who figured
in the history of the epoch. The worst part of all
is, the Heaven of the upper plan of the picture,
into which the soul of the Count has the bad taste
to apply for admission. This was, in fact, one of
the works which gave occasion to the saying of a
critic of a contemporary school, who declared that
the Glorias (heavenly visions) of the Greco looked
like Infernos, and his Infernos like Glorias.</p>

<p>In the Transito there is an Adoration, a charming
picture, apparently by Rembrandt. There are
here and there good pictures among the other
churches, but none very remarkable. In general,
the most attractive objects are the old picture-frames,
and other gilded ornaments and wood carvings. All
these, in the taste of the commencement of the last
century and earlier, which is at present so much
in request, are in such profusion, as would draw tears
of admiration from the eyes of a Parisian upholsterer,
and showers of bank notes from the purses
of furniture collectors.</p>

<p>You will not, I am sure, by this time, object to
our quitting Toledo, and making a short excursion<a name="page_205" id="page_205"></a>
in its environs. I shall therefore request you
to accompany me to the ruins of a Moorish palace,
on the banks of the Tagus, a mile distant from
the town, called the Palacio de Galiana. The Princess
Galiana was the daughter of Galafre, one of
the earlier Arab Kings of Toledo. The widely
extended fame of her beauty, is said to have fired
the imagination of Charles, son of Pepin, King of
France, who resolved to throw himself at her feet
as a suitor, and forthwith repaired to Toledo. However
glowing the terms in which report had represented
her charms, he found them surpassed by the
reality; but a prince of a neighbouring state had
forestalled him in his suit. This obstacle did not,
however, deter him from persisting in his resolution.
He forthwith challenged his rival to mortal combat;
and, clearing his road to the hand of the princess
with the point of his lance, married her, and carried
her back with him to Paris.</p>

<p>The attachment of her father to this princess is
said to have been such from her earliest childhood,
that he gave himself up entirely to this affection&mdash;devoting
all his wealth to the gratification of her
caprices. The Arab palace, now no longer in existence,
took its name from hers, in consequence of
a new one having been erected for her by her father,
adjoining his own, at a period at which she had<a name="page_206" id="page_206"></a>
scarcely grown out of childhood. The two residences
being occupied by succeeding princes as one, received
the appellation of los Palacios, (the Palaces) of Galiana.</p>

<p>In addition to her town residence, she soon after
had the other palace constructed about a mile from
Toledo. To arrive at the ruins, we pass the bridge
of Alcantara, and follow the rose-tree promenade.
From this a path on the left-hand leads to the spot
across a field in garden-like cultivation. The selection
made by the Arab princess of this situation,
proves her to have possessed, in addition to her
beauty, a consummate taste and intelligence of rural
life.</p>

<p>The Tagus&mdash;a name, by the way, more deserving
of poetic fame than many a more widely echoed
stream&mdash;in this spot, as if conscious of the pains he
must shortly undergo, while dashing through the
deep and narrow chasm through which he must force
a passage around Toledo, seems to linger, desirous of
putting off the fated storm. His course becomes
more circuitous as he approaches; and indulging in
a hundred irregularities of form, he plays round
several small thickly wooded islands, penetrating with
innumerable eddies and back currents, into flowery
nooks and recesses; while here and there he spreads
out in a wide sheet his apparently motionless waters,<a name="page_207" id="page_207"></a>
as if seeking to sleep away the remainder of his days
on these green and luxurious banks.</p>

<p>In the midst of this delicious region, which recalls
to the recollection some of the more favoured spots
in England, but which, with the addition of the
Spanish climate in early summer, is superior to them
all, was placed the palace. The valley for a considerable
distance still bears the name of the Garden
of the King,&mdash;Huerta del Rey. The site of part of
the pleasure grounds immediately adjoining the
river, is left wild, and covered with woods; and the
remainder is converted into a farm in the highest
state of cultivation. The ruin consists of three sides
of a not very large quadrangle; the massive walls of
which are pierced with two stories of arched windows.
The remainder of the edifice was doubtless
less solid, and has entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Many a tale of romance would be gathered&mdash;many
a stirring scene recorded, could so precious a document
be brought to light as a chronicle drawn up by
some St. Simon of the Court of Toledo, who had
recorded the daily events of which this retreat was
the theatre, during the time it served as a residence
for several successive sovereigns. But in this land
words have always been fewer than deeds, and records
are the rarest sort of subsisting monuments.
One anecdote, however, is transmitted, of which this<a name="page_208" id="page_208"></a>
spot was the scene, in the time of the last but one of
the Moorish princes who reigned at Toledo, before
its surrender to Alonzo the Sixth.</p>

<p>Alonzo was himself one of the actors on the occasion.
In early life he had been deprived by his
brother Sancho, King of Castile, of the portion of the
kingdoms which fell to his share by the will of his
father, Ferdinand the First. On his expulsion from
his inheritance he took refuge at the court of the
Arab king of Toledo, by whom he was received with
every mark of favour which could have been lavished
on a friend. The Moor (for the family then reigning
was not Arab, although the two races are constantly
confounded in Spanish histories) gave him a palace,
and settled on him splendid revenues, to be continued
during the time he should think fit to accept
his hospitality. He even sent invitations to all the
friends and followers of his guest, in order that he
might be surrounded with his own court.</p>

<p>Alonzo, touched by this delicate hospitality, attached
himself warmly to his host; his friendship
for whom (I believe a solitary instance in those times
among the sovereigns in Spain) lasted until the death
of the latter. The youthful exile, thus handsomely
treated, passed much of his time in the society of his
royal protector.</p>

<p>On one occasion, the court being at the country<a name="page_209" id="page_209"></a>
palace of Galiana, the king and his attendants were
reclining in the cool shade of the garden, and Alonzo
at a short distance, apparently asleep. The king,
pointing to the town, which towered on its precipice
immediately in front of the party, was expatiating on
the strength of its position. All agreed that it was
impregnable; until a brother of the monarch observed,
that there was one mode of warfare against
which it would not hold out: and he proceeded to
explain his plan, which consisted of an annual devastation
of the valley of the Tagus at the time of
harvest, to be executed by an invading army, which
might be disbanded during the winter months. This
system, he maintained, would inevitably reduce the
city by famine to the necessity of a surrender.</p>

<p>No sooner was the last phrase uttered, than all present
in an instant struck by the same thought, turned
towards the sleeper; and the greater number, filled
with suspicion respecting the reality of his slumbers,
addressed significant looks to the king, the intention
of which could not be mistaken, and which boded no
good to Alonzo. Whatever might have been the
feelings of the Moor at this moment, he took no
further notice of the incident, and allowed his guest
to terminate his nap when he thought proper.</p>

<p>When the death of Sancho took place before
Zamora, Alonzo was still at Toledo. The intelligence<a name="page_210" id="page_210"></a>
being conveyed to him by a confidential messenger
from his sister, he lost no time in taking
leave of his host, who wished him success with
every demonstration of friendship, and repairing to
Burgos. There, after some hesitation, the nobles
consented to his investiture with the sovereignty.
During his brilliant reign he resisted several tempting
opportunities of breaking with his Moorish ally
and former host, and thus adding to his dominions,&mdash;and
preserved his friendship and loyalty unstained.
After the death of the Moorish king, he, however,
speedily fell out with his successor. War was declared
on both sides, and it was resolved to attack
Toledo. The well known result was, the taking of
the town after seven years, the time mentioned in
the garden of Galiana, and by means of the annually
repeated devastation of the Vega, according to the
plan imagined and described in the above mentioned
conversation.</p>

<p>Returning by the Rose-tree Walk, immediately on
approaching the bridge, an advanced portion of the
cliff which bounds the road on the left detaches
itself from the rest towards the summit, which rises
in a circular form. On it stands the Castle of San
Servando, one of the most picturesque of the Arab
remains existing in this part of Spain. The origin
of this fort is uncertain. Some attribute it to the<a name="page_211" id="page_211"></a>
Romans, and consider the Moorish windows and
ornaments to be subsequent additions, from their
being constructed with bricks instead of the same
stone as the rest of the walls. But this is not a sufficient
reason, since the same peculiarity exists in all
the Arab edifices in Toledo. In fact, the reason is
evident. The hard black sort of stone used for the
walls, would almost have defied the chisel which
should have attempted to fashion its surface into the
delicate forms required by the Arab mode of decorating.
This argument, therefore, being set aside&mdash;remains
the masonry, which is more likely from its
appearance to be Gothic or Arab, than Roman.</p>

<p>It is probably entirely Arab. It encloses a quadrangular
space of about a quarter of an acre, and is
a ruin; but the walls and towers are almost entire.
There are three small towers, that is of small
diameter, but lofty; and two larger, one of which
is circular: the other is a parallelogram terminating
by a semicircle at one of its extremities. This tower
has lost apparently about a third of its elevation.
Their walls are so perfectly constructed as to appear
externally like solid rocks smoothed and rounded.
Each larger tower contains two rectangular brick
projections, in which are small elegantly-arched openings
for windows.</p>

<p>The edifice was thoroughly repaired by Don Pedro<a name="page_212" id="page_212"></a>
Tenorio, archbishop of Toledo; the same who built
the bridge of San Martin. It has since played its
part in numberless wars, and was at length reduced
to a ruin during the insurrection headed by Juan de
Padilla, at the commencement of Charles the Fifth's
reign.</p>

<p>During the Peninsular war of the present century,
the old battlements echoed once more with
the sounds of warfare. It was occupied by a body
of French, who repaired a portion of the masonry
at the summits of the towers, and erected a low
wall along the whole length of the Toledo side.
They were able, from their position, to batter the
Alcazar, which is immediately opposite, but on a
higher level; and to command the bridge of Alcantara,
and road to Aranjuez.</p>

<p>In the other valley which extends to the west
of Toledo exist the remains of a circus for chariot
races, generally supposed, at first sight, to be Roman.
They present, in fact, every characteristic of a Roman
work. The rough interior masonry is all that
remains; and that only rising to a height of from
three to four feet from the ground, with the exception
of a single arch. The earth mingled with
ruins, has apparently filled up much of the interior,
and surrounding the exterior simultaneously, has
only left visible the upper portion of the edifice.<a name="page_213" id="page_213"></a>
The end which is in the best preservation is of a
semicircular form. From it the sides run in parallel
directions, and lose themselves in the ruins of a more
recently erected convent. They are traceable to a
length of more than four hundred yards. The
width is two hundred and ninety feet within the
building, at the present elevation of the ground,
and three hundred and twenty feet on the outside,
which appears to have consisted of a series of arches.
There are also remains of an amphitheatre adjoining
the semicircular end of the stadium.</p>

<p>There being no indication of the Romans having
at any period planted any considerable establishment
at Toledo, in fact no author but Livy
having noticed the place, and he but slightly; the
antiquaries have sought for the origin of these monuments
among Gothic traditions; and it is believed
by them, that they were erected during the early
part of the sixth century, by Theudio, a Gothic
King, who manifested much attachment to Roman
customs.<a name="page_214" id="page_214"></a></p>

<h5>CASTLES OF ALMONACID, GUADAMUR, MONTALBAN, AND
ESCALONA. TORRIJOS.</h5>

<p class="r">Toledo.<br />
</p>

<p>I met this morning with an entertaining scene,
in a quarter in which it might be the least looked
for. The archiepiscopal palace contains an excellent
library, which has always been open to the
public. Although the revenues of the see are now
withdrawn, and the palace is vacant, the books remain
on the shelves, and the head librarian, a <i>racionero</i>
of the cathedral, has the good nature to throw open
the rooms from eleven to twelve, on all days of
labour, (as those are called on which no saint is celebrated,)
although he no longer enjoys a salary,
nor the means of providing a single attendant to
see to what passes in the different apartments.</p>

<p>I was occupied this morning in the <i>racionero's</i>
room, when he received a visit from two French
tourists, both persons of notoriety; one being a<a name="page_215" id="page_215"></a>
member of the chamber of deputies, and one of
the leaders of the republican party; and the other,
I believe, also in the chamber, but principally known
as a writer of political pamphlets, in which the
French reigning family, and the powers that be are
lashed with unwearying severity. The first mentioned
personage commenced the conversation in
Spanish, which the other did not speak: but on
hearing the librarian make an observation in French,
the pamphleteer took up the argument in his own
language, and nearly in the following terms.</p>

<p>"As this gentleman understands French, I will
explain to him the object of my tour," and addressing
himself to the Spaniard, he continued&mdash;"I find
it a relief, in the midst of my arduous political
duties, to make an occasional excursion in a foreign
country, and thus to enlarge the sphere of my usefulness,
by promoting the cause of humanity in the
various localities I visit. It is thus that I have
recently passed through Andalucia, and have recommended,
and, I doubt not, successfully, to the principal
personages possessed of influence in its numerous
cities, the establishment of all sorts of useful
institutions. I am now in Toledo, animated
with the same zeal. I have obtained an introduction
to you, Sir, understanding that you are an
individual possessed of considerable influence, and<a name="page_216" id="page_216"></a>
enjoying unbounded means of carrying out the
projects, which, I doubt not, you will agree with
me in considering essential to the well being and
improvement, both moral and material, of your ancient
locality."</p>

<p>During this exordium, the Spaniard, who happens
to be possessed of a vivacity, unusual in his
countrymen, and a sort of impatience of manner,
had endeavoured more than once to obtain a hearing.
At length he replied, that he feared it would
not be in his power to carry out the views which
Monsieur did him the honour to communicate to
him, owing to the absence of sufficient resources
at his disposal, whether for public purposes, or in
his individual and private capacity.</p>

<p>The Frenchman was not, however, to be so easily
discouraged. "This, Sir," he replied, "is the result
of your modesty; but I am persuaded that I
have only to make my objects understood, in order
to obtain their complete execution. For instance,
one of the most insignificant in expense, but of
infinite utility, is this: it would be a source of
much gratification to me, if you would have the
most conspicuous spots throughout Toledo ornamented
with statues, representing, with greater or
less resemblance, all the personages, distinguished
from various causes in the history of Spain, to whom<a name="page_217" id="page_217"></a>
Toledo has given birth. These works I should
wish to be entrusted to artists of acknowledged talent,
and"&mdash;he was proceeding with constantly increasing
rapidity of enunciation, when the exhausted
librarian's patience being at an end, he interrupted
the torrent. "However grateful the city of Toledo
and myself must be for your interest and advice,
I am grieved to repeat that my anxiety to
comply with your wishes is totally powerless. We
are without funds; and I, for my own part, can
assure you that I am <i>sans le sou</i>. Do me the favour
to name any service of a less expensive nature, and
I shall rejoice in proving to you my entire devotion.
Excuse my <i>impolitesse</i>. I am called for in
the next room. I kiss your hand." It is needless,
in fact the attempt would baffle human intelligence,
to conjecture what the real object of these
very liberal and very political gentlemen might be,
in honouring all parts of Spain with their visit.</p>

<p>The more distant environs of Toledo, principally
towards the south and south-east, are remarkable
for a profusion of ruined castles. Supposing a circle
drawn at a distance of thirty miles from Toledo
as its centre, and divided, as it would be, by the
Tagus, descending from east to west, into two equal
parts, the southern half, and the western portion
of the other, are so plentifully strewed with these<a name="page_218" id="page_218"></a>
fortresses, that, in many instances, five or six are
visible from the same point of view.</p>

<p>A chain of low mountains crosses the southern
portion of the semicircle, in a parallel line with
the Tagus. Some of its branches advance into
this region, and terminate in detached peaks, which
have afforded to the aristocracy of former times
favourable positions for their strongholds; and a
still greater number of proprietors, not being possessed
of the same advantages of site, were compelled
to confide in the solidity of their walls and
turrets, which they constructed in the plain, usually
adjoining the villages or towns inhabited by their
vassals. The greater number of these edifices are
of a date subsequent to the surrender of Toledo
to the Christians, and were erected on the distribution
of the different towns and estates among
the nobility, on their being successively evacuated
by their Moorish proprietors. The Count of Fuensalida,
Duke of Frias, is the most considerable landed
proprietor on this side of Toledo, and several
of the ruined castles have descended to him.</p>

<p>I will not fatigue you by the enumeration of all
these remains, of which but a few are remarkable
for picturesque qualities, and still fewer for the possession
of historical interest, as far as can be known
at present. One of them, situated ten miles to the<a name="page_219" id="page_219"></a>
south-east of Toledo, and visible from its immediate
neighbourhood, attracts notice owing to its striking
position. Occupying the summit of a conical
hill, which stands alone on the plain, and placed
at four times the elevation of Windsor Castle, you
expect to find it connected with the history of some
knightly Peveril of the Peak, but learn with surprise
that it was the stronghold of the Archbishops
of Toledo; and was erected by Don Pedro Tenorio,
the same prelate who rebuilt the bridge of San
Martin, and repaired the Moorish castle of San
Servando.</p>

<p>Before you ascend the peak, you pass through
the village of Almonacid, from which the castle
takes its name, and which, unlike that more recently
erected pile, is completely Arab in aspect. All the
houses are entered through back courts, and present
no difference of appearance, whether shops, taverns,
<i>posadas</i>, or private residences. After tying my horse
in the stable of the posada, and giving him his meal
of barley, which he had carried in the <i>alforjas</i> (travelling
bags) suspended behind the saddle, I took
my own provisions out of the opposite receptacle,
and established myself before the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>On my asking for wine, the hostess requested I
would furnish her with two <i>quartos</i> (one halfpenny)
with which she purchased me a pint, at the tavern<a name="page_220" id="page_220"></a>
next door. The host of the posada, who was seated
next me, and a friend at the opposite corner of
the fire-place, favoured me, during my meal, with
their reminiscences of a battle fought here, during
the Peninsular war. They had not heard of the
English having taken any part in the quarrel, with
the exception of the old woman, who recollected
perfectly the name of Wellington, and pronounced
it as perfectly, but thought he had been a Spanish
general. They described the battle as a hard fought
one, and won by the French, who marched up the
hill with fixed bayonets, as the old host, almost blind,
described by assuming the attitude of a soldier jogging
up a hill, and dislodged the Spanish garrison
from the castle.</p>

<p>I could have willingly passed a week in this village,
so exciting are the remains of Arab manners
to the curiosity. The name of the place had already
raised my expectations, but the blind landlord of
the posada unconsciously won my attachment from
the first moment. No sooner was I seated, than,
leaning towards me, and patting my arm to draw
my attention, he pointed to his two eyes. At first
I was at a loss to understand him; but soon discovered
that he was desirous of knowing whether
I was sufficiently versed in the mysteries of Esculapius,
to prescribe for the relief of his suffering<a name="page_221" id="page_221"></a>
organs. To this trait he soon added one still more
characteristic, by actually speaking of Toledo, by
its Moorish appellation Tolaite. Had he worn a
turban, sat cross-legged and offered me coffee and
a pipe, I should not have been more taken by surprise,
than by this Arab expression assailing the
ear, in the heart of Spain, ten miles from the town
itself, in which the name had probably not been
uttered for three or four centuries.</p>

<p>The builder of the castle of Almonacid must have
placed more confidence in the difficulties of approach,
than in the solidity of his structure. The
walls are partly of stone, and partly of <i>tapia</i>, or
earth. There only remain, the exterior wall, enclosing
an area of about sixty to seventy yards in
diameter, and of a pentagonal form; and, in the
centre, the keep, a quadrangular tower, somewhat
higher than the rest of the buildings. There are
no traces of living apartments. At each of the five
angles of the outer wall, is a small tower, and others
in the centres of some of the fronts; those looking
to the west are circular, the rest square. The nearer
view of this ruin causes disappointment, as it appears
to have been a slovenly and hasty construction:
but, at a distance, its effect is highly picturesque.</p>

<p>The castle of Montalban is situated to the south-west<a name="page_222" id="page_222"></a>
of Toledo, at a distance of six Spanish leagues.
It resembles, in size and importance, some of the
largest English castles; and justifies thus far the
tradition preserved here, of its having for a short
period, served for a royal prison&mdash;Juan the Second
being said to have been confined there by his exasperated
favourite, Don Alvaro de Luna. This
story is not, however, confirmed by historians, several
of whom I have vainly consulted, for the purpose
of discovering it. Ferreras mentions the castle, or
rather the town, which lies at a distance of two
leagues (eight miles) from it, as having belonged to
the queen of Juan the Second; who, he states, was
deprived of it, against her will, in favour of Don
Alvaro, and another place given her in exchange.
On the confiscation of the favourite's possessions,
previous to his decapitation, it reverted to the crown;
and there is no further notice taken of it in the
history, until the Emperor Charles the Fifth,
confers on its then proprietor the title of Count.
This personage was Don Alonzo Tellez Giron, third
in descent from Juan Pacheco, Duke of Escalona,
who had erected Montalban into a separate fief, in
favour of one of his sons and his descendants, on
the singular condition of the family name undergoing
a change, on each successive descent. The
alternate lords were to bear the names respectively<a name="page_223" id="page_223"></a>
of Giron and Pacheco. The first Count of Montalban
married a daughter of D. Ladron de Guevara,
proprietor, <i>à propos</i> of castles, of that of Guevara,
in the neighbourhood of Vitoria, constructed in an
extremely singular form. The centre tower appears
intended to imitate the castles of a chess-board. It
is situated on the southern declivity of the chain
of mountains, a branch of the Pyrenees, which separates
the province of Guipuscoa from those of Navarre
and Alava.</p>

<p>On the opposite descent of the chain another fortress
existed in remote times. Both were strongholds
of robbers, whose descendants derived their family
name, Ladron (robber) from their ancestors' profession.
In a document signed by D. Garcia Ramirez,
King of Navarre in 1135, D. Ladron de Guevara,
governor of Alava, figures among the grandees of
the kingdom; the descendants were afterwards called
lords of Oñate, and the castle is at present the property
of the Count de Oñate, a grandee of the first
class. From its occupying a point <i>stratégique</i> of considerable
importance, commanding the plain of Alava,
and the high road as it enters the valley of Borunda,
it has been in recent times occupied by the Carlists,
and fortified.</p>

<p>Montalban belongs at present to the Count of
Fuensalida. It is completely ruinous, but the outer<a name="page_224" id="page_224"></a>
wall is almost entire; and one of two lofty piles
of building, in the form of bastions, which flanked
the entrance, is in sufficient preservation to allow
the apartments to be recognised. Their floors were
at a height of about eighty feet from the ground;
and the mass of masonry which supported them,
is pierced by an immense gothic arch reaching to
the rooms. The opposite corresponding mass remains
also with its arch; but the upper part which
contained rooms, no longer exists. On this, the entrance
side, the approach is almost level, and the
defence consisted of a narrow and shallow moat;
but the three other sides, the fortress being of a
quadrangular form, look down into a deep ravine,
through which a river, issuing from the left, passes
down two sides of the castle, and makes for the valley
of the Tagus, which river is seen at a distance
of five or six miles.</p>

<p>The precipice at the furthest side descends perpendicularly,
and is composed of rocks in the wildest
form. The river below leaps from rock to rock, and
foams through a bed so tormented, that, although
owing to its depth of at least five hundred feet from
the foundations of the castle, it looks almost like a
thread, it sends up a roar not less loud than that of
the breakers under Shakspeare's Cliff. The valley,
opening for its passage, gives to the view, first, the<a name="page_225" id="page_225"></a>
Tagus, on the opposite bank of which lies the town
of Montalban, dependant on the lords of the castle;
beyond it an extensive plain, dotted with castles and
towns, most of them on the road from Madrid to
Talavera; and at the horizon the Sierra del Duque,
coated with snow from about half its height upwards.
The extent of the view is about sixty miles.</p>

<p>The outer enceinte of the castle of Montalban encloses
a space of five or six acres in extent, in which
no buildings remain, with the exception of the picturesque
ruin of a small chapel in the centre. Like
almost all other residences possessed of scenery sufficiently
precipitous, this castle boasts its lover's leap.
A projection of wall is pointed out, looking over the
most perpendicular portion of the ravine, to which a
tradition is attached, deprived by time of all tangible
distinctness, if ever it possessed any. The title given
to the spot in this instance is "The Leap of the
Moorish Girl," Despeñadera de la Mora. The position
will probably bear no comparison with the Leucadian
promontory; nor is it equal to the Peña de
los Enamorados, near Antequera, in Andalucia, immortal
likewise in the annals of passion, and of which
the authentic story is preserved. Of those in our
country I could name one&mdash;but I will not, though
few know it better&mdash;nor is it the meanest of its tribe.
But with these exceptions I know of none among the<a name="page_226" id="page_226"></a>
numerous plagiarisms of the famous lover's leap of
antiquity that offers to despair in search of the picturesque
more attractions than the Despeñadera of
Montalban.</p>

<span class="caption">CASTLE OF GUADAMUR.</span>
</div>

<p>The best preserved castle of these environs, and
the handsomest building, is that of Guadamur. It is
not large, but it is impossible for a residence-fortress
to be more complete, and more compact. It is composed
of three enclosures, one within the other, and
forms a quadrangle, with the addition of a lofty and
massive tower, projecting from one of the angles.
The centre, or inner quadrangle, is about half the<a name="page_227" id="page_227"></a>
height of the tower, and has, at its three remaining
angles, and at the centre of each front, an elegant
circular turret. This portion of the edifice formed
a commodious and handsome residence. It was divided
into two stories, with vaulted ceilings,&mdash;the
lower apartments being probably set apart for the
offices of attendants, and places of confinement for
prisoners: in the centre of the upper story was a
diminutive open court, supported by the vaults of
the ground-floor, and into which a series of elegantly
proportioned rooms opened on all sides. Although
the greater part of the vaults and interior walls are
fallen in, the rooms are all to be traced, and inscriptions
in the old Gothic letter run round the walls of
some of the apartments. A second enclosure rises
to about two-thirds of the elevation of the inner
quadrangle, and is provided with corresponding turrets;
but the proportions of these are more spacious,
and their construction and ornament more massive.
Beyond this are the exterior defences rising out of the
moat, and very little above the surrounding ground.</p>

<p>Viewed from without, nothing indicates that this
edifice is a ruin. Over the entrance are the arms of
the Counts of Fuensalida. It is supposed by many
that this castle was erected by Garcilaso de la Vega,
grandfather of the "Prince of Spanish poets," as the
celebrated bard of Toledo is entitled. Others maintain<a name="page_228" id="page_228"></a>
its founder to have been Pedro Lopez de Ayala,
first Count of Fuensalida. This latter story is the
more probable one; since, besides its being confirmed
by the armorial shield above mentioned, it has been
adopted by Haro in his Nobiliario, a work drawn up
with care and research, in which Garcilaso de la
Vega is stated to have purchased some towns from
the family of Ayala,&mdash;among others Cuerva, in the
near neighbourhood, but not Guadamur.</p>

<p>The Ayalas were descended from the house of
Haro, lords of Biscay. Several of them had held
high offices at the Court of Castile. The grandfather
of the founder of the castle had been High Chancellor
of Castile, and Great Chamberlain of Juan the
First; and his father, the first lord of Fuensalida,
was High Steward, and first Alcalde of Toledo. He
lost an eye at the siege of Antequera,&mdash;taken from
the Moors by Ferdinand, afterwards King of Aragon,
in the year 1410, and thus acquired the surname of
the One-eyed. To him Juan II. first granted the
faculty of converting his possessions into hereditary
fiefs: "Because," according to one of the clauses of
the act, "it was just that the houses of the grandees
should remain entire in their state for the eldest
son; and in order that the eldest sons of the
grandees might be maintained in the estates of
their predecessors, that the name and memory of the<a name="page_229" id="page_229"></a>
grandees of the kingdom might not be lost, and that
the hereditary possessions and houses, and the generations
of the sons of grandees might be preserved."</p>

<p>It was Pedro Lopez de Ayala, son of the one-eyed
lord of Fuensalida created Count by Enrique the
Fourth, that built the castle. He was a great favourite
with the king, and his constant companion, notwithstanding
his being afflicted with deafness&mdash;a bad
defect in a courtier, and which procured him also
a surname. He succeeded his father in his different
dignities. His loyalty did not keep pace with
his obligations to Henry the Fourth; for, being first
Alcalde of Toledo, he made no effort to prevent that
town from joining the party of the Prince Alonzo, who
pretended to his brother's crown; but he was recalled
to his allegiance by the devoted exertions of his wife.</p>

<p>This lady was Doña Maria de Silva, a daughter of
Alonzo Tenorio de Silva, Adelantado of Cazorla. On
the breaking out of the rebellion of Toledo, she
agreed with her brother Pedro de Silva, Bishop of
Badajos, to send a joint letter to the king, in which
they pressed him to come to Toledo in disguise.
Enrique the Fourth approved of the plan; and
arriving in the night, accompanied by a single attendant,
was received by the bishop at his residence
in the convent of San Pedro Martir. Notwithstanding
the darkness, he had been recognised by a servant<a name="page_230" id="page_230"></a>
of Marshal Payo de Ribera, a partisan of Prince
Alonzo. This noble, immediately on learning the
king's arrival, joined with the Alcalde, who had not
been let into the secret by his wife, and called the
citizens to arms by sounding the great bell of the
cathedral. A crowd was speedily assembled at the
king's lodging, who would have been immediately
made prisoner, but for his attendant Fernando de
Ribadenegra, who succeeded, single handed, in repulsing
a party who had forced an entrance.</p>

<p>At this crisis the disloyal magistrate became
alarmed, and sent his two sons, Pedro de Ayala, and
Alonzo de Silva, accompanied by Perafande Ribera,
son of the above-mentioned marshal, to entreat the
king to quit the town. Henry consented; and at
midnight left the convent, accompanied by the
three youths. He had ridden sixteen leagues that
day, and his horses being exhausted with fatigue,
he requested the two sons of Ayala to lend him
theirs. They did so, and accompanied him on foot
as far as the city gates, where he left them, and set
off for Madrid.</p>

<p>In order to pacify the people, Pedro Lopez ordered
his brother-in-law, the bishop, to quit the town, and
he repaired to the Huerta del Rey, a country-house
in the environs. On arriving at Olias the king sent
the two brothers, in recompense of their good service,<a name="page_231" id="page_231"></a>
a deed of gift of seventy thousand <i>maravedis</i> of
annual revenue.</p>

<p>The grief of Maria de Silva at the failure of her
project was such as almost to deprive her of her
reason, and added to the eloquence of her entreaties
to win over her husband to the king's
interests. He now, therefore, exerted himself to gain
the principal citizens, and succeeded so completely,
that within three days from the departure of Enrique
the Fourth, he was enabled to recall the Bishop of
Badajos to Toledo, and to banish in his stead the
Marshal de Payo and his son, who retired to their
estates. Unanimous was now the cry of "Viva
Enrique Quarto, y Mueren los rebeldes!" and the
following day, a Sunday, the king re-entered Toledo
in the midst of the general joy and festivity, and
preceded directly to the residence of the Alcalde,
in order to thank his wife for her loyal efforts.
A lodging was there in readiness to receive him,
which he occupied during his stay in Toledo. Pedro
Lopez de Ayala received on the king's return to
Madrid the title of Count of his town of Fuensalida,
and shortly afterwards, at Medina del Campo, a grant
of the towns of Casaruvias del monte, Chocas, and
Arroyomolinos.</p>

<p>The town and castle of Escalona are situated at
eight leagues, or thirty-two miles, to the east of<a name="page_232" id="page_232"></a>
Toledo. It is one of the towns, about a dozen in
number, the foundation of which is attributed by the
Count de Mora, in his history of Toledo, to the Jews.
He fixes the date at about five centuries before the
Christian era, when a large number of Israelites, to
whom Cyrus, king of Babylon, had granted their
liberty, arrived in Spain under the guidance of a
Captain Pirrus, and fixed themselves principally in
and around Toledo. He also states that the synagogue
of Toledo&mdash;since called Santa Maria la Blanca&mdash;was
erected by them. The name given by them to
Escalona was Ascalon. The neighbouring Maqueda
was another of their towns, and was called Mazeda.
It was created a duchy by Ferdinand and Isabella in
favour of their courtier Cardenas. I cannot learn
the date of the castle of Escalona. Alonzo the Sixth
won the town from the Moors; and it is probable
that the castle was erected, at least in part, by Diego
and Domingo Alvarez, two brothers, to whom he
granted the place. After their death it reverted to
the crown of Castile, and continued to be royal property
until Juan II. gave it to his favourite Don
Alvaro de Luna.</p>

<p>This grandee was known to have amassed great
treasures in the castle; and on the confiscation of
his possessions at the period of his final disgrace, the
king marched an army to take possession of the<a name="page_233" id="page_233"></a>
fortress; but the countess held out successfully, and
obliged the royal troops to raise the siege. On a
second attempt, made after Don Alvaro's execution,
his widow considered she had no further object in
maintaining it, and lost no time in coming to terms.
The conditions of the surrender were, that the treasure
should be divided into three equal parts, one
for the king, another for herself, and the third for
her son. The son was likewise allowed to inherit the
castle, and by the marriage of his daughter, it came
into the possession of the Marquis of Villena, D.
Lopez Pacheco, created Duke of Escalona by Henry
the Fourth. The family of Fellez Giron, proprietors
of Montalban, were descendants of this duke. At
present the castle of Escalona belongs to the Duke
of Ossuna. It is not only the most considerable of
the numerous ruins disposed over the territory of
Toledo, but one of the most interesting historical
relics of Spain, having filled an important place in
the annals of several of the most stirring periods.
The unfortunate Blanche, Queen of Pedro the Cruel,
was its inmate during several years; as also her rival,
Maria de Padilla, at a subsequent period.</p>

<p>The best excursion from Toledo in point of architectural
interest, is that to Torijos, a small town
situated rather to the left of the direct road to
Escalona, and five leagues distant. Immediately<a name="page_234" id="page_234"></a>
before arriving there, the castle of Barciense is met
with, situated on an eminence which commands an
admirable view, extending south and west to a semi-circle
of mountains, composed of the Sierra del
Duque, and the chain called the mountains of Toledo,
and for a foreground looking down on a perfect
forest of olive-grounds, surrounding the town of
Torijos, two miles distant. The ruin of Barciense
consists of a lofty square tower, and the outer walls
of a quadrangle. There is nothing worth notice,
with the exception of a bas-relief, which occupies all
the upper half of the tower on the east side. It consists
of a solitary lion rampant; probably the largest
crest ever emblazoned. The Dukes of Infantado
were proprietors of this castle.</p>

<p>The little town of Torijos contains a Gothic, or
rather semi-Moorish palace, two Gothic churches, an
ancient picturesque gateway, and the ruins of a magnificent
monastery. It is one of those towns here
and there met with on the Continent, which, at a
favourable crisis of the arts, have fallen to the proprietorship
of one of those individuals idolised by
architects&mdash;men whose overplus of fortune is placed
at the disposal of their eyes, and employed in ministering
to the gratification of those organs. The
greater part of the decoration of Torijos dates from
the reign of Ferdinand the Catholic, when it belonged<a name="page_235" id="page_235"></a>
to D. Gutiere de Cardenas, father of the first
duke of Maqueda. The following story is related
respecting the founding of the monastery by his
wife Teresa Enriquez.</p>

<p>This lady resided, when at Toledo, in a mansion,
the ruins of which still exist, on the opposite side of
the street to the monastery of San Juan de los Reyes,
of which I sent you a description in a former letter.
Being warmly attached to religious observances, (for
she went by the name of Teresa la Santa,) and animated
with an enthusiastic fervour towards everything
which appertained to the splendid establishment in
front of her residence, she had discovered a position,
from which a view could be obtained, overlooking
the principal scene of the religious ceremonies of the
Franciscans. She there caused a window to be
constructed, splendidly ornamented in the Arab style,
and kneeling on a rich <i>prie-dieu</i>, she united her daily
devotions with those of the <i>frailes</i>.</p>

<p>No small sensation was caused by this proceeding,
most perceptible probably within the monastery, on
the discovery being made by the brethren of the
addition to their holy fraternity. The cardinal became
alarmed, and intimated to Doña Teresa that
the window was ill-placed,&mdash;that it admitted too much
light in a wrong direction; that, in short, it must
disappear. The veto of the all-powerful Ximenes de<a name="page_236" id="page_236"></a>
Cisneros, already regarded as the dispenser of the
royal frowns and favours, could not be resisted. The
window was blocked up; but the interference was
replied to in terms pointed with pious pique and
holy revenge. The lady declared verbally to the
prelate that she had no need of his convent, for she
would found a more splendid one at Torijos. This
threat, immediately put in execution, produced the
building I mentioned above, the ruin of which is all
that now remains.</p>

<p>Of the inhabited portions the external walls alone
remain. The cloister is almost entire, and the church
has only lost its roof. The rich tracery surrounding
the doorways, and the sculpture in all parts of the
interior, consisting chiefly of repetitions of the
founder's armorial bearings&mdash;in imitation or satire of
the profusion of similar ornament in San Juan de los
Reyes&mdash;are entire, and appear as though they had
been recently executed. The church is designed
after the plan of San Juan, but the style of its ornament
is much more elegant. The cloister is, however,
very inferior to that of Toledo, and the whole
establishment on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>Every traveller in search of the picturesque knows
in how great a degree his satisfaction has been increased
whenever the meeting with a scene deserving
of his admiration assumes the nature of a discovery.<a name="page_237" id="page_237"></a>
For this reason, the chapters of tourists should never
be perused before a journey&mdash;independently of their
possessing more interest subsequently to an acquaintance
having been made with the country described.
Strictly speaking written tours are intended
for those who stay at home.</p>

<p>But the most favourable first view of a highly admirable
building or landscape, is the one you obtain
after the perusal of tours and descriptions of the
country, in none of which any notice is taken of that
particular object or scene. The village of Torijos is
approached under these advantageous circumstances.
Every step is a surprise, owing partly to the above
cause, and partly to one's being inured to the almost
universal dreariness and ugliness of the villages and
small towns of this part of Spain. The appearance
under these circumstances of a beautiful Gothic cross
and fountain, of an original and uncommon design,
outside the walls of the place, and the open tracery
of the tall windows of the ruined monastery at the
other side of a green meadow, creates an agreeable
surprise, and adds considerably to the pleasure which
would be derived from the same objects, had expectation
been already feeding on their beauties.
Imagine, then, the discovery, after leaving behind
these monuments, (sufficient for the immortality of
a score of Castilian villages,) of the façade of the<a name="page_238" id="page_238"></a>
principal church, consisting of one of the richest and
most exquisite specimens of Gothic decoration in
Spain; and, a street further on, of a second ornamental
portal of a different sort, but Gothic likewise,
giving access to a half Arab palace.</p>

<p>The Count of Altamira is the proprietor of this
place, but neither he nor any of his family have
inhabited the edifice for several years, and it is allowed
to go to decay. Some of the <i>artesonado</i> ceilings,
more especially that of the chapel in form of
a cupola, admit the light through the joinings of the
gilded woodwork. A large hall on the first-floor,
which formed the anteroom to a suite of inner apartments,
decorated in the Arab style, has been taken
possession of by the <i>haute volée</i> of Torijos for their
public ball-room. A tribune for musicians is placed
against one of the end walls, and adorned with paper
festoons. A placard, inscribed with the word <i>galop</i>,
was visible in front of the seat of the leader of the
band, indicating that the Torijos balls terminate with
that lively dance. There was no furniture in that
nor any other part of the house, with the exception
of an <i>entresol</i> inhabited by the count's steward.
This person no sooner learned that I was an Englishman,
than he commenced setting in the best possible
light the advantages the premises possessed for the
establishment of every sort of manufactory.<a name="page_239" id="page_239"></a></p>

<p>It appears the proprietor is anxious to dispose of
the building; and as all the English pass here for
manufacturers, owing to the principal articles of
common use, introduced by smugglers, being English,
the worthy factotum had instantly made up his
mind that I was the purchaser sent by Providence to
take the old edifice off his master's hands. He is
evidently either promised a bonus on the success of
his efforts to sell, or he wished to pass with the property;
for his idea produced a degree of zeal most
useful towards the satisfaction of my curiosity, and
without which his patience would have been exhausted
before I had completed the view of the building.
One peculiarity of the rooms consists in the
ceilings&mdash;that is, the ornamental ones&mdash;being nearly
all either domes, or interiors of truncated pyramids.
There is only one flat. It is ornamented with the
shell of the arms of the Cardenas family&mdash;each of the
hundreds of little square compartments having one
in its centre. The staircase is adorned with beautiful
Gothic tracery.<a name="page_240" id="page_240"></a></p>

<h5>VALLADOLID. SAN PABLO. COLLEGE OF SAN GREGORIO. ROUTE
BY SARAGOZA.</h5>

<p class="r">Tolosa.<br />
</p>

<p>I should have sent you an account of my excursion
to Valladolid at the time it took place, but
was prevented by the shortness of my stay and the
hurry of my departure from Madrid, which immediately
followed. I preserved, however, memoranda
of the limited explorations which were to be made
during a flying visit of three days, and will now
give you the benefit of them, such as they are; as
also of my experience of the public travelling in that
direction. You will recommend your friends, who
may visit this land of adventure, and are careful at
the same time of their personal comforts, to wait the
introduction of railroads, before attempting this excursion,
when you hear that I met with three upsets
in one night, and was afforded, in all, nearly five
hours' leisure for contemplating the effect of moonlight
upon the sleeping mules and an upside-down
carriage!<a name="page_241" id="page_241"></a></p>

<p>The town of Valladolid contains monuments of
much interest, although none of great antiquity.
The greater number date from the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, and form a chain, illustrative
of the progress of architecture in this country, subsequently
to the abandonment of the Gothic style.
This style is, however, worthily represented by two
edifices, placed in juxtaposition, and ornamented
each with a façade of extraordinary richness. I will
content myself with the endeavour to give you some
idea of these two buildings, which, although belonging
to a style so common in England and France,
are totally unlike all the Gothic specimens I am
acquainted with in those countries.</p>

<p>The largest of the two is the monastery of San
Pablo. It was a foundation of much magnificence,
and the building has sustained very little injury,
owing to its having, immediately on the expulsion
of the monks, been applied to other uses, instead
of being deserted and left to decay. It is now a
Presidio, or central prison for condemned malefactors.
The cloister is a superb quadrangle, of the
pointed style of the end of the fourteenth century,
and is the usual resort of the prisoners, who
are grouped so thickly over its pavement, that it
is with difficulty one passes between them, without
adding to the clanking of chains as their wearers<a name="page_242" id="page_242"></a>
change their posture to make way. The façade
of the church is enclosed between two small octagon
towers without ornament, like a picture in a frame.
Within these all is sculpture. The door-way is
formed of a triple concentric arch, flanked by rows
of statues, all of which are enclosed within another
arch, which extends across the whole width, from<a name="page_243" id="page_243"></a>
tower to tower. Over this there is a circular window,
surrounded with armorial escutcheons, and
the remainder of the façade is covered with groups
of figures in compartments, up to the summit, a
height of about a hundred and thirty feet, where
there is a pediment ornamented with an immense
armorial shield and lions rampant as supporters,
and the whole is surmounted by a cross.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 367px;">
<a href="images/ill_268_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/ill_268_sml.jpg" width="367" height="550" alt="FAÇADE OF SAN PABLO." title="FAÇADE OF SAN PABLO." /></a>
<span class="caption">FAÇADE OF SAN PABLO.</span>
</div>

<p>The church was erected by the celebrated Torquemada,
who was a monk in the establishment.
Doña Maria, Queen of Sancho the Fourth, although
mentioned as the founder of the monastery, only
completed a small portion of the edifice compared
to what was subsequently added. A handsome tomb
by Pompeyo Leoni, is seen in the church. It is
that of Don Francisco de Sandoval, Duke of Lerma,
and his wife. The woodwork of the stalls is by
Ferrara. It is adorned with fluted Doric columns,
and is composed of walnut, ebony, box and cedar.
The superb façade of this church and its sumptuous
tracery, had well nigh been the cause of a misunderstanding
between the representative of the Spanish
Government and myself. To obtain admission
to the interior of the building, which I was told
had become national property, I addressed my humble
request in writing to the <i>gefe politico</i>, or governor
of the province, resident at Valladolid. I left<a name="page_244" id="page_244"></a>
the note at his official residence, and was requested
to return at an hour appointed, when I was to obtain
an audience. The functions of a <i>gefe politico</i>
answer to those of no provincial functionary in England,
or any other constitutional state&mdash;he has more
authority even than a Préfet in France. He represents
the monarchical power, with this difference,
that he is uncontrolled by parliament within the
limits of his province. Although not charged with
the military administration, he can direct and dispose
of the armed force; besides being a sort of local
home minister and police magistrate; in fact, the
factotum or <i>âme damnée</i> of the Cromwell of the
moment, with whom he is in direct and constant
communication on the affairs of his district.</p>

<p>I was at Valladolid during the regency of Espartero,
when the cue given to these functionaries,
relative to the <i>surveillance</i> of foreigners was very
anti-French, and favourable to England. Now in
the eyes of a <i>gens-d'armes</i> every one is a thief
until he can bring proof to the contrary, just as by
the jurisprudence of certain continental countries,
every accused is presumed criminal&mdash;just as every
one who comes to a Jew is presumed by him
to have old clothes to sell, or money to borrow.
Thus, owing to the nature of the duties of the
Governor of Valladolid, every foreigner who met<a name="page_245" id="page_245"></a>
his eye, was a Frenchman, and an <i>intrigant</i>, until
he should prove the reverse.</p>

<p>Not being aware of this at the time, I had drawn
up my petition in French. On my return for the
answer, my reception was any thing but encouraging.
The excessive politeness of the Spaniard was
totally lost sight of, and I perceived a moody-looking,
motionless official, seated at a desk, with his hat
resting on his eyebrows, and apparently studying a
newspaper. I stood in the middle of the room for
two or three minutes unnoticed; after which, deigning
to lift his head, the personage inquired in a gruff
tone, why I did not open my cloak. I was not as
yet acquainted with the Spanish custom of drawing
the end of the cloak from off the left shoulder,
on entering a room. I therefore only half understood
the question, and, being determined, at whatever
price, to see San Pablo, I took off my cloak,
laid it on a chair, and returned to face the official.
"I took the liberty of requesting your permission to
view the ancient monastery of San Pablo."&mdash;"And,
pray, what is your reason for wishing to see San
Pablo?"&mdash;"Curiosity."&mdash;"Oh, that is all, is it!"&mdash;"I
own likewise, that, had I found that the interior
corresponded, in point of architectural merit, with
the façade, I might have presumed to wish to
sketch it, and carry away the drawing in my portmanteau.<a name="page_246" id="page_246"></a>"&mdash;"Oh,
no doubt&mdash;very great merit. You
are a Frenchman?"&mdash;"I beg your pardon, only an
Englishman."&mdash;"You! an Englishman!!" No answer.
"And pray, from what part of England do you
come?" I declined the county, parish, and house.</p>

<p>These English expressions, which I had expected
would come upon his ear, with the same familiarity
as if they had been Ethiopian or Chinese, produced
a sudden revolution in my favour. The Solomon
became immediately sensible of the extreme tact
he had been displaying. Addressing me in perfect
English, he proceeded to throw the blame of my
brutal reception on the unfortunate state of his
country. "All the French," he said, "who come
here, come with the intention of intriguing and doing
us harm. You wrote to me in French, and that
was the cause of my error. The monastery is now
a prison; I will give you an order to view it, but
you will not find it an agreeable scene, it is full of
criminals in chains." And he proceeded to prepare
the order.</p>

<p>Not having recovered the compliment of being
taken for a conspirator; nor admiring the civilisation
of the governor of a province, who supposed that
all the thirty-four millions of French, must be <i>intrigants</i>,
I received his civilities in silence, took the
order, and my departure. The most curious part<a name="page_247" id="page_247"></a>
of the affair was, that I had no passport at the time,
having lost it on the road. Had my suspicious interrogator
ascertained this before making the discovery
that I was English, I should inevitably have
been treated to more of San Pablo than I desired,
or than would have been required for drawing it in
detail.</p>

<p>The adjoining building is smaller, and with less
pretension to magnificence is filled with details far
more elaborate and curious. The Gothic architecture,
like the Greek, assumed as a base and principle
of decoration the imitation of the supposed primitive
abodes of rudest invention. The Greek version of
the idea is characterised by all the grace and finished
elegance peculiar to its inventors; while the same
principle in the hands of the framers of Gothic architecture,
gave birth to a style less pure and less refined;
but bolder, more true to its origin, and capable
of more varied application. In both cases may
be traced the imitation of the trunks of trees; but
it is only in the Gothic style that the branches are
added, and that instances are found of the representation
of the knots and the bark. In this architecture,
the caverns of the interior of mountains
are evidently intended by the deep, multiplied, and
diminishing arches, which form the entrances of cathedrals;
and the rugged exterior of the rocky mass,<a name="page_248" id="page_248"></a>
which might enclose such a primæval abode, is
imaged in the uneven and pinnacled walls.</p>

<span class="caption">FAÇADE OF SAN GREGORIO, VALLADOLID.</span>
</div>

<p>The façade of the college of San Gregorio, adjoining
San Pablo, furnishes an example of the Gothic
decoration brought back to its starting point. The
tree is here in its state of nature; and contributes
its trunk, branches, leaves, and its handfuls of twigs
bound together. A grove is represented, composed
of strippling stems, the branches of some of which,
united and bound together, curve over, and form
a broad arch, which encloses the door-way. At each
side is a row of hairy savages, each holding in one
hand a club resting on the ground, and in the
other an armorial shield. The intervals of the sculpture
are covered with tracery, representing entwined
twigs, like basket-work. Over the door is a stone
fourteen feet long by three in height, covered with
<i>fleurs-de-lis</i> on a ground of wicker-work, producing
the effect of muslin. Immediately over the arch is a
large flower-pot, in which is planted a pomegranate
tree. Its branches spread on either side and bear
fruit, besides a quantity of little Cupids, which cling
to them in all directions. In the upper part they
enclose a large armorial escutcheon, with lions for
supporters. The arms are those of the founder of
the college, Alonzo de Burgos, Bishop of Palencia.
On either side of this design, and separated respectively<a name="page_249" id="page_249"></a>
by steins of slight trees, are compartments
containing armed warriors in niches, and armorial
shields. All the ornaments I have enumerated cover
the façade up to its summit, along which project
entwined branches and sticks, represented as broken
off at different lengths.</p>

<span class="caption">COURT OF SAN GREGORIO. VALLADOLID.</span>
</div>

<p>The court of this edifice is as elaborately ornamented
as the façade, but it was executed at a much
later period, and belongs to the renaissance. The
pillars are extremely elegant and uncommon. The
doorway of the library is well worthy of notice; also<a name="page_250" id="page_250"></a>
that of the refectory. The college of San Gregorio
was, in its day, the most distinguished in Spain.
Such was the reputation it had acquired, that the
being announced as having studied there was a
sufficient certificate for the proficiency of a professor
in science and erudition. It is still a college, but no
longer enjoys the same exclusive renown. In the
centre of the chapel is the tomb of the founder,
covered with excellent sculpture, representing the
four virtues, and the figures of three saints and the
Virgin. It is surrounded by a balustrade ornamented
with elaborate carving. Berruguete is supposed
to have been the sculptor, but in the uncertainty
which exists on the subject, it would not be
difficult to make a better guess, as it is very superior
to all the works I have seen attributed to that artist.
At the foot of the statue of the bishop is the following
short inscription, "Operibus credite." To this
prelate was due the façade of San Pablo; he was
a Dominican monk at Burgos, where he founded
several public works. He became confessor, chief
chaplain, and preacher to Isabel the Catholic: afterwards
Bishop of Cordova; and was ultimately
translated to the see of Palencia. He received the
sobriquet of Fray Mortero, as some say from the
form of his face, added to the unpopularity which he
shared with the two other favorites of Ferdinand<a name="page_251" id="page_251"></a>
and Isabella,&mdash;the Duke of Maqueda, and Cardinal
Ximenes, with whom he figured in a popular triplet
which at that period circulated throughout Spain,</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">Cardenas, el Cardenal,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Con el padre Fray Mortero,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Fraen el reyno al retortero.</td></tr>

<p class="nind">which may be freely translated thus:</p>

<tr><td align="left">What with his Grace the Cardinal,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">With Cardenas, and Father Mortar,&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Spain calls aloud for quarter! quarter!</td></tr>

<p>The concise inscription seen on the tomb, was
probably meant as an answer to this satire, and to the
injurious opinion generally received respecting his
character.</p>

<p>I returned from Toledo by way of Madrid and
Saragoza. The diligence track from Toledo to
Madrid was in a worse state than at the time of my
arrival: a circumstance by no means surprising, since
what with the wear and tear of carts and carriages,
aided by that of the elements, and unopposed by
human labour, it must deteriorate gradually until
it becomes impassable. Since my last visit to the
Museo the equestrian portrait of Charles the Fifth
by Titian has been restored. It was in so degraded
a condition that the lower half, containing the foreground
and the horses' legs, presented scarcely a
distinguishable object. It has been handled with<a name="page_252" id="page_252"></a>
care and talent, and, in its present position in the
centre of the gallery, it now disputes the palm with
the Spasimo, and is worth the journey to Madrid,
were there nothing else to be seen there. I paid
another visit to the Saint Elizabeth in the Academy,
and to the Museum of Natural History, contained
in the upper floor of the same building. This gallery
boasts the possession of an unique curiosity; the
entire skeleton of a Megatherion strides over the
well-furnished tables of one of the largest rooms. I
believe an idea of this gigantic animal can nowhere
else be formed. The head must have measured
about the dimensions of an elephant's body.</p>

<p>From Castile into Aragon the descent is continual,
and the difference of climate is easily perceptible.
Vineyards here climb the mountains, and the plains
abound with olive-grounds, which are literally
forests, and in which the plants attain to the growth
of those of Andalucia. In corresponding proportion
to the improving country, complaints are heard of its
population. Murders and robberies form the subject
of conversations; and certain towns are selected
as more especially <i>mal-composées</i>, for the headquarters
of strong bodies of <i>guardia civile</i>; without
which precaution travelling would here be attended
with no small peril. This state of things is attributed
partly to the disorganising effects of the<a name="page_253" id="page_253"></a>
recent civil war, which raged with peculiar violence
in this province. The same causes have operated
less strongly in the adjoining Basque provinces, from
their having to act on a population of a different
character,&mdash;colder, more industrious, and more pacifically
disposed, and without the desperate sternness
and vindictive temper of the Aragonese.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this province differ in costume
and appearance from the rest of the Spaniards. Immediately
on setting foot on the Aragonese territory,
you are struck by the view of some peasant at the
road-side: his black broad-brimmed hat,&mdash;waistcoat,
breeches, and stockings all of the same hue,
varied only by the broad <i>faja</i>, or sash of purple,
make his tall erect figure almost pass for that of
a Presbyterian clergyman, cultivating his Highland
garden. The natives of Aragon have not the
vivacity and polished talkativeness of the Andalucian
and other Spaniards; they are reserved, slow, and
less prompt to engage in conversation, and often
abrupt and blunt in their replies. These qualities
are not, however, carried so far as to silence the
continual chatter of the interior of a Spanish diligence.
Spanish travelling opens the sluices of communicativeness
even of an Aragonese, as it would those
of the denizens of a first class vehicle of a Great
Western train, were they exposed during a short
time to its vicissitudes.<a name="page_254" id="page_254"></a></p>

<p>However philosophers may explain the phenomenon,
it is certain that the talkativeness of
travellers augments in an inverse ratio to their
comforts. The Spaniards complain of the silence
of a French diligence; while, to a Frenchman, the
occupants of the luxurious corners of an English
railroad conveyance, must appear to be afflicted with
dumbness.</p>

<p>Saragoza is one of the least attractive of Spanish
towns. Its situation is as flat and uninteresting
as its streets are ugly and monotonous. The ancient
palace of the sovereigns of Aragon is now the
Ayuntamiento. It would form, in the present day,
but a sorry residence for a private individual, although
it presents externally a massive and imposing
aspect. Its interior is almost entirely sacrificed to an
immense hall, called now the Lonja. It is a Gothic
room, containing two rows of pillars, supporting a
groined ceiling. It is used for numerous assemblies,
elections, and sometimes for the carnival balls. The
ancient Cathedral of La Seu is a gothic edifice, of
great beauty internally; but the natives are still
prouder of the more modern church called Nuestra
Señora del Pilar,&mdash;an immense building in the
Italian style, erected for the accommodation of
a statue of the Virgin found on the spot, standing
on a pillar. This image is the object of peculiar
veneration.<a name="page_255" id="page_255"></a></p>

<p>After leaving Saragoza you are soon in the Basque
provinces. The first considerable town is Tudela in
Navarre; and here we were strongly impressed with
the unbusinesslike nature of the Spaniard. This
people, thoroughly good-natured and indefatigable
in rendering a service, when the necessity arises for
application to occupations of daily routine appear to
exercise less intelligence than some other nations.
It is probably owing to this cause that at Madrid the
anterooms of the Foreign Office, situated in the
palace, are, at four in the afternoon, the scene of
much novelty and animation. In a town measuring
no more than a mile and a half in each direction,
the inexperienced stranger usually puts off to the last
day of his stay the business of procuring his passport,
and he is taken by surprise on finding it to be the
most busy day of all. Little did he expect that the
four or five <i>visas</i> will not be obtained in less than
forty-eight hours: and he pays for his place in
the diligence or mail (always paid in advance)
several days before. It is consequently worth while
to attend in person at the Secretary of State's
office, in search of one's passport, in order to witness
the scene.</p>

<p>The hour for the delivery of these inevitable
documents, coincides with the shutting up for the
day of all the embassies: so that those which<a name="page_256" id="page_256"></a>
require the subsequent <i>visa</i> of an ambassador, have
to wait twenty-four hours. Hence the victims of
official indifference, finding themselves disappointed of
their departure, and minus the value of a place in the
mail, give vent to their dissatisfaction in a variety
of languages, forming a singular contrast to the
phlegmatic and <i>impassible</i> porters and ushers, accustomed
to the daily repetition of similar scenes.
Some, rendered unjust by adversity, loudly accuse
the government of complicity with the hotel-keepers.
I saw a Frenchman whose case was cruel. His
passport had been prepared at his embassy, and as
he was only going to France, there were no more
formalities necessary, but the visa of the police, and
that of the foreign office. All was done but the
last, and he was directed to call at four o'clock.
His place was retained in that evening's mail, and
being a mercantile traveller, both time and cash were
of importance to him. On applying at the appointed
hour, his passport was returned to him without the
<i>visa</i>, because the French Secretary had, in a fit of
absence, written Cadiz, instead of Bordeaux&mdash;he
was to wait a day to get the mistake rectified.</p>

<p>These inconveniences were surpassed by that to
which the passengers of our diligence were subjected
at Tudela. Imagine yourself ensconced in a corner
of the Exeter mail (when it existed) and on<a name="page_257" id="page_257"></a>
arriving at Taunton, or any intermediate town,
being informed that an unforeseen circumstance rendered
it necessary to remain there twenty-four hours,
instead of proceeding in the usual manner. On
this announcement being made at Tudela, I inquired
what had happened, and learned that a diligence,
which usually met ours, and the mules of which
were to take us on, was detained a day at Tolosa,
a hundred miles off. Rather than send a boy to
the next stage to bring the team of mules, which
had nothing to do, a dozen travellers had to wait
until the better fortunes of the previous vehicle
should restore it to its natural course.</p>

<p>As if this contretems was not sufficient, we were
subjected to the most galling species of tyranny,
weighing on the dearest of human privileges, I mean
that which the proprietor of a shilling,&mdash;zwanziger,
franc, or pezeta,&mdash;feels that he possesses of demanding
to be fed. We had left Saragoza at nine in
the morning, and had arrived without stoppages at
six. A plentiful dinner, smoking on the table of the
<i>comedor</i>, might have produced a temporary forgetfulness
of our sorrows: but no entreaties could
prevail on the hostess to lay the table-cloth. It
was usual for the joint supper of the two coaches
to take place at nine, and not an instant sooner
should we eat. Weighed down by this complication<a name="page_258" id="page_258"></a>
of miseries, we sat, a disconsolate party, round
the <i>brasero</i>, until at about eight our spirits began
to rise at the sight of a table-cloth; and during
half an hour, the occasional entrance of a waiting
woman, with the different articles for the table,
kept our hopes buoyed up, and our heads in motion
towards the door, each time it opened to give entrance,
now to a vinegar cruet, now to a salt-cellar.</p>

<p>At length an angelic figure actually bore in a
large dish containing a quantity of vegetables, occasioning
a cry of joy to re-echo through our end
of the room. She placed it on a side-board and
retired. Again the door opened, when to our utter
dismay, another apparition moved towards the dish,
took it up and carried it away; shutting the door
carefully behind her. This was the best thing
that could have occurred; since it produced a sudden
outburst of mirth, which accompanied us to
the table, now speedily adorned with the materials
of a plentiful repast.</p>

<p>The next town to Tudela, is the gay and elegant
little fortress of Pamplona, from which place an
easy day's journey, through a tract of superb mountain
scenery, brings you to Tolosa, the last resting-place
on the Spanish side.<a name="page_259" id="page_259"></a></p>

<h5>SEVILLE.</h5>

<h3><a name="LETTER_XV" id="LETTER_XV"></a>LETTER XV.</h3>

<h5>JOURNEY TO SEVILLE. CHARACTER OF THE SPANIARDS. VALLEY
OF THE RHONE.</h5>

<p class="r">Marseille.<br />
</p>

<p>In order to reach the south of Spain, the longest
route is that which, passing through France,
leads by Bayonne to the centre of the northern
frontier of the Peninsula, which it then traverses
from end to end. It is not the longest in actual
distance; but in regard to time, and to fatigue,
and (for all who do not travel by Diligence), by far
the longest, with regard to expense. Another route,
longer, it is true, in distance, but shorter with respect
to all these other considerations, is that by Lyons
and Marseille; from either of which places, the
journey may be made entirely by steam.</p>

<p>The shortest of all, and in every respect, is that
by the Gibraltar mail, which leaves London and
Falmouth once a week. This is a quicker journey<a name="page_260" id="page_260"></a>
than that through France, even for an inhabitant
of France, supposing him resident at Paris, and to
proceed to England <i>viâ le Hâvre</i>. But there is an
objection to this route for a tourist. Desirous of
visiting foreign scenes, he will find it too essentially
an English journey&mdash;direct, sure, and horribly business-like
and monotonous. You touch, it is true,
at Lisbon, where during a few hours, you may escape
from the beef and Stilton cheese, if not from
the Port wine; and where you may enjoy the view
of some fine scenery; but all the rest is straight-forward,
desperate paddling night and day; with the
additional objection, that being surrounded by English
faces, living on English fare, and listening to
English voices, the object of the traveller&mdash;that of
quitting England&mdash;is not attained; since he cannot
be said to have left that country, until he finds
himself quarrelling with his rapacious boatman on
the pier of the glittering Cadiz.</p>

<p>Although this arrangement may possess the merit
of the magic transition from England to Andalucia,
which, it must be allowed, is a great one&mdash;many
will prefer being disembarked in France; looking
forward, since there is a time for all things, to a
still more welcome disembarkation on England's
white shores, when the recollected vicissitudes of
travel shall have disposed them to appreciate more<a name="page_261" id="page_261"></a>
than ever her comforts and civilization, and to be
more forgiving to her defects; and, should they
not be acquainted with the banks of the Rhone
below Lyons, adopting that equally commodious and
infinitely more varied course.</p>

<p>In fact, there are few who will not agree with
me in pronouncing this the best way, for the tourist,
of approaching Spain. It is not every one, who will
not consider the gratifications which the inland territory
of the Peninsula may offer to his curiosity too
dearly purchased by the inconveniences inseparable
from the journey. Add to this the superiority
of the maritime provinces, with scarcely any exception,
in point of climate, civilization, and attractions
of every sort. Valencia, Barcelona, Malaga, and
Cadiz are more agreeable places of residence, and
possess more resources than even Madrid; but their
chief advantage is a difference of climate almost
incredible, from the limited distance which separates
them from the centre of the Peninsula. The Andalucian
coast enjoys one of the best climates in
the world; while the Castiles, Aragon, and La Mancha
can hardly be said to possess the average advantages
in that respect; owing to the extremes of
cold and heat, which characterize their summer and
winter seasons, and which, during autumn and spring,
are continually alternating in rapid transition.<a name="page_262" id="page_262"></a></p>

<p>Andalucia unites in a greater degree than the
other maritime provinces, the advantages which constitute
their superiority over the rest of Spain. It
does more, for it presents to the stranger a combination
of the principal features of interest, which
render the Peninsula more especially attractive to
the lover of travel. It is, in fact, to Spain what
Paris is to France; Moscow and Petersburg to Russia.
England, Italy, and Germany are not fit subjects
for illustrating the comparison; their characteristic
features of attraction and interest being disseminated
more generally throughout all their provinces
or states. Whoever wishes to find Spain
herself, unalloyed, in her own character and costume,
and in her best point of view, should disembark
in Andalucia.</p>

<p>There, unlike the Castiles, and the still more
northern provinces, in which only the earth and
air remain Spanish, and those not the best Spanish&mdash;where
all the picturesque and original qualities
that distinguish the population, are fast fading away&mdash;the
upper classes in their manners and costumes,
and the Radicals in their politics, striving to become
French&mdash;there, on the contrary, all is natural and
national in its half-Arab nationality: and certainly
nature and nationality have given proof of taste
in selecting for their last refuge, the most delicious<a name="page_263" id="page_263"></a>
of regions; where earth and heaven have
done their utmost to form an abode, worthy of
the most beautiful of the human, as well as the
brute creation.</p>

<p>I will not pause to inquire whether the reproach
be justly addressed by the other Spaniards, to the
inhabitants of this province, of indolence and
love of pleasure, and of a disposition to deceitfulness,
concealed beneath the gay courtesy of their
manners; it would, indeed, be a surprising, a miraculous
exception to the universal system of compensations
that we recognise as governing the world,
had not this people some prominent defect, or were
they not exposed to some peculiar element of suffering,
to counterbalance in a degree the especial and
exclusive gifts heaped upon them. By what other
means could their perfect happiness be interfered
with? Let us, then, allow them their defects&mdash;the
necessary shade in so brilliant a picture&mdash;defects
which, in reducing their felicity to its due level,
are easily fathomed, and their consequences guarded
against, by sojourners amongst them, in whose eyes
their peculiar graces, and the charm of their manner
of life, find none the less favour from their
being subject to the universal law of humanity.
They cannot be better painted in a few words, than
by the sketch, drawn by the witty and graceful<a name="page_264" id="page_264"></a>
Lantier, from the inhabitants of Miletus. "Les
Milesiens," he says, "sont aimables. Ils emportent,
peut-être, sur les Athéniens" (read "Castillans")
"par leur politesse, leur aménité, et les agrémens
de leur esprit. On leur reproche avec raison cette
facilité&mdash;cette mollesse de m&#339;urs, qui prend quelquefois
l'air de la licence. Tout enchante les sens
dans ce séjour fortuné&mdash;la pureté de l'air&mdash;la beauté
des femmes&mdash;enfin leur musique&mdash;leurs danses, leurs
jeux&mdash;tout inspire la volupté, et pénêtre l'âme d'une
langueur délicieuse. Les Zéphirs ne s'y agitent que
pour repandre au loin l'esprit des fleurs et des
plantes, et embaumer l'air de leurs suaves odeurs."</p>

<p>This passage is, word for word, so exactly applicable
to the Andalucians and their land, that it is
difficult to imagine another people to have sat for
the portrait, nor to a more talented painter. It is
a pity that the author I quote, is a rarity in modern
libraries: owing, perhaps, to his descriptions being
at times rather warm, or, as his compatriots would
say, <i>un peu regence</i>.</p>

<p>In Spain, the country of proverbs, they are very
fond of summing up, by the aid of a few epithets, the
distinctive character of each province. As bad qualities
frequently predominate in these estimates, it
is of course usual for the individual, who undertakes
the instruction of a foreigner in this department<a name="page_265" id="page_265"></a>
of knowledge, to omit the mention of his own province.
After all, the defects attributed to the inhabitants
of one portion of a country by those of
another, are not to be taken for granted without
considerable reservation; allowance must be made
for rivalry and jealousies. Almost every country
affords examples of these wholesale accusations laid
to the charge of particular counties or divisions of
territory. Thus the character usually attributed
in Spain to the Andalucians, is that of a people lively,
gay, of extreme polish and amiability of manners,
but false and treacherous. The Galicians are said
to be stupid and heavy, but remarkably honest; the
Catalonians courageous but quarrelsome, <i>mauvais coucheurs</i>.
No doubt in some of these instances, the
general impression may be borne out to a certain
extent, by some particular class of the denizens of the
province alluded to; but such distinctions are rarely
perceptible among the educated classes. It is perhaps
less easy in Spain than elsewhere, to establish
these classifications at all successfully. Contradictions
will be met with at every step, calculated to shake
their infallibility. To our eye, as foreigners, there
are sufficient peculiarities belonging to the nation
universally, and respecting which our knowledge
is far from being complete, without attempting to
classify a greater or smaller list of subdivisions, the<a name="page_266" id="page_266"></a>
appreciation of which would require a prolonged
residence in the country.</p>

<p>Spain is looked upon by the greater number of
strangers as a land delivered over to depredation,
and highly insecure. In fact, it is surprising that
such should not be the fate of a country in which
instruction is limited, and where, as I myself have
witnessed, servants may be known to be in the
daily practice of stealing without their dismissal
being by any means a necessary result. It is surprising,
that in the absence of any strong natural
objection to theft, any honesty should exist in the
presence of temptation; yet I know no country
where there is more, if I may form an opinion from
the individuals of whom I have had an opportunity
of judging. However, as an instance of the contradictions
one meets with, the following event was
represented as having taken place in one of the
provinces in which I had received the favourable
impression above-mentioned.</p>

<p>A ci-devant colonel, just arrived in Madrid, related
the fact to me one evening, on which, as chance
would have it, I found him at supper. Immediately
on my entering the room he commenced complaining
of the lack of silver articles of necessity for the table,
and accounted for it in the following manner. He
had recently arrived with his family from a provincial<a name="page_267" id="page_267"></a>
town, in which he had filled a government
situation. Shortly before his departure he had invited
all his friends to a leave-taking repast; and
after the departure of his guests nearly two dozen
articles of plate were missing. "In packing up,"
I observed, "no doubt some dishonest domestic&mdash;"
"No, no," he interrupted, "they were all pocketed by
my guests."</p>

<p>That the man in office should have conciliated the
attachment of all his acquaintances to such a degree,
as that all should conceive simultaneously the idea
of preserving a <i>souvenir</i> of his person, and that in so
delicate and unostentatious a manner,&mdash;was not possible.
As, therefore, I still retained my impression of
the honesty of the lower classes, and as the sufferer
appeared to treat the occurrence as one by no means
extraordinary, I came to the conclusion, that&mdash;either
Spanish integrity, unlike that of other nations, must
rise in an inverse ratio to men's fortunes and
stations; or that the author of the anecdote had been
tempted, by the desire of masking the (perhaps unavoidable)
deficiencies in his supper service, to have
recourse to his inventive talent, at the expense of his
absent friends' reputation.</p>

<p>I believe it must be allowed that with respect
to the disregard of the rights of proprietorship, of
which the lower classes are accused, there are sufficient<a name="page_268" id="page_268"></a>
instances on record to counterbalance, in some
degree, my personal experience; but there is this to
be urged in favour of that class of culprits, where
such are met with, that their mode of operation is
far more manly and courageous than that of the
depredators of some other climes&mdash;by which means
they obtain also the full reputation of their misdeeds.
There may scarcely be said to be anything mean or
degrading in their manner of thieving: and their
system is itself a proof that they see no sin in
it. They take to the mountains, and declare open
war against those whom they consider the unjust
monopolizers of wealth.</p>

<p>Instances of this sort are no doubt frequent in
Spain; in Toledo they relate that, some years since,
the passes of Estremadura were occupied by one of
the most formidable and best organized of these
bands, under the orders of a female. Various versions
were given of this woman's history; but the one
most accredited accounted in the following manner
for her having adopted the profession of freebooter.
A young lady of rank had disappeared from her
family residence, leaving no trace by which to guide
conjecture as to her fate. It was therefore presumed
she had been kidnapped. The event, however, had
already long ceased to be a subject of conversation
in the district, when three or four years after, a<a name="page_269" id="page_269"></a>
traveller, who had escaped from an attack of banditti,
announced the fact of their being commanded by
a woman. Although well disguised, her voice, and
delicate figure had betrayed her sex. The fact was
subsequently confirmed by positive discoveries; and,
at length, confiding in the alteration time and her
mode of life had produced in her appearance, she
ceased to make a mystery of the circumstance, and
headed the attacks, mounted usually on a large black
horse. Her age and beauty coinciding with the
description given of the young countess who had
disappeared some years previously, gave rise to the
supposition of their identity. The band has been
since dispersed, and many of them captured; but
their chief has contrived to escape, and it is probable
the truth respecting her may never be divulged.</p>

<p>It is said she at times exercised more pitiless
cruelties than are usually practised by the male
chiefs of the regular banditti; and that, after such
acts,&mdash;as though conscience-stricken,&mdash;she would, by
way of compensation, allow parties to pass unmolested.</p>

<p>From such instances as these a portion of the
Spanish population must be considered amenable
to the charge brought against them; but there are
peculiarities of a different stamp, which mark the<a name="page_270" id="page_270"></a>
Spaniards in general, and are more deserving of
notice in a summary of the national characteristic
qualities. It is impossible, for instance, not to be
struck by the intelligence and tact, independent
of cultivation, which pervade all classes. Whether
the denizens of these southern climes are indebted to
the purity of their atmosphere, for this gift of rapid
perception, in which they surpass our northern organizations,
or to whatever cause they may owe it; the
fact leads to involuntary speculation on what might
have been the results, in a country so distinguished,
besides, by its natural advantages, had the Arab supremacy
lasted until our days. At a period when
education was generally held in no estimation in
Europe, the first care of almost every sovereign of
that race was usually directed to the establishment,
or improvement, of the public schools, in which the
sciences and languages were taught at the royal
expense. No town being unprovided with its schools,
it is difficult to imagine to what degree of superiority
over the rest of Europe the continuation of such
a system would have raised a people so gifted as
to be capable of supplying, by natural intelligence,
the almost universal absence of information and
culture.</p>

<p>You continually meet with such instances of uncultivated
intelligence as the following. I was occupied<a name="page_271" id="page_271"></a>
in sketching in a retired part of the environs of
Madrid, when a ragged, half-naked boy, not more
than ten or eleven years of age, and employed in
watching sheep, having to pass near me, stopped to
examine my work. He remained for nearly a
quarter of an hour perfectly still, making no movement
except that of his eyes, which continually
travelled from the paper to the landscape, and
back from that to the paper. At length, going
away, he exclaimed, "Que paciencia, Dios mio!"</p>

<p>The following is an example of the absence of
cultivation, where it might have been expected to
exist. A student leaving the university of Toledo,
at the age of twenty-seven, told me he had studied
there eleven years, and had that day received his
diploma of barrister, which, when sent to Madrid,
where it would be backed by the sanction of the
minister, would authorise him to practise his profession
in any town throughout Spain. In the course
of the same conversation, he asked me whether Russia
was not situated in the Mediterranean, and whether
England did not form a portion of that country.</p>

<p>Tact and good manners are so universal among
the lower classes, that a more familiar intercourse
than we are accustomed to, can be allowed between
persons of different ranks. Those of the highest
class are seen, during a journey, dining at the same<a name="page_272" id="page_272"></a>
table with their servants; and on all other occasions
entering into conversation with them. This intercourse
of good nature and good understanding,
universally existing between superiors and inferiors,
and which is never known to degenerate into
familiarity, would preserve Spain a long time from
revolutions of a popular origin&mdash;were she left to
herself. The Spaniard of the lowest station has as
considerable an idea of his personal consequence as a
marquis, and maintains with his equals all the forms
of high breeding. If you stop to listen to the discussions
of a knot of ragged children playing at
marbles, you will hear them address each other by
the title of Señor.</p>

<p>The urbanity and polish which prevails throughout
all classes is genuine, and the result of good-nature.
This is proved by their readiness to render
all sorts of services as soon as they are acquainted
with you, and even before; and <i>that</i> notwithstanding
their suspicion and dislike of strangers, a disposition
for which they have ample cause. I don't
mean to include services which might incur pecuniary
outlay; it would be something like requesting
the loan of the Highlander's inexpressibles. Although
even of this a remarkable instance has fallen
under my observation,&mdash;the capability existing,&mdash;but
they will spare no trouble nor time: doubling the<a name="page_273" id="page_273"></a>
value of the obligation by the graceful and earnest
manner of rendering it.</p>

<p>Should your reception by a Spaniard be marked
by coldness, it is generally to be accounted for by a
very excusable feeling. The Spaniard is usually deeply
preoccupied by the unfortunate state of his country.
This subject of continual reflection operating on a
character singularly proud, but which is at the same
time marked by a large share of modesty,&mdash;qualities
by no means incompatible,&mdash;occasions him a sensation
when in presence of a foreigner nearly approaching
to suffering. He feels a profound veneration
for the former glories of his land, and admiration
of its natural superiority; but he is distrustful
of his modern compatriots, of whom he has no great
opinion. His anxiety is, therefore, extreme with regard
to the judgment which a Frenchman or Englishman
may have formed respecting his countrymen and
country: and he is not at his ease until satisfied
on that point; fearing that the backward state of
material civilization may be attributed by them to
hopeless defects in the national character, and diminish
their respect for his country. He is restored
to immediate peace of mind by a delicate compliment,
easily introduced, on the ancient grandeur of
Spain, or the eternal splendour of her skies and soil,
and especially by an expression of disapproval of the<a name="page_274" id="page_274"></a>
influence which foreign governments seem desirous of
arrogating to themselves over her political destinies.</p>

<p>Should the stranger delay the application of some
such soothing balm, he will not hesitate to provoke
it, by ingeniously leading the conversation in the
direction he wishes, and then heaping abuse and
censure on his compatriots.</p>

<p>The interference of foreign governments in their
politics is, in fact, one of the consequences of the
present national inferiority, the most galling to their
feelings. This is accounted for by the high independence,
which is one of the principal features of
their character, and is observable in the most insignificant
events of their daily life. The practice
which prevails in some countries, of meddling each
with his (and even <i>her</i>) neighbour's concerns, and of
heaping vituperation where a man's conduct or
opinions differ from his who speaks, is one of the
most repugnant to the Spanish nature. If a
Spaniard hears such a conversation, he stares vacantly,
as though he comprehended nothing; and
the natural expression traceable on not a few countenances
and attitudes may be translated, "I don't
interfere in your affairs, pray don't trouble yourself
about mine."</p>

<p>It is curious to trace this in their favourite sayings,
or proverbs (<i>refrans</i>), by which the national peculiarities<a name="page_275" id="page_275"></a>
of character are admirably depicted. Of
these no people possess so complete a collection.
The following is one which expresses the feeling to
which I allude:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">El Marques de Santa Cruz hizó</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Un palacio en el Viso:</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Porque pudó, y porque quisó.</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="nind">or, translated,</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">What could induce Sir Santa Cruz to</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Build a house the Viso close to?</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&mdash;He had the money, and he chose to.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>I place, in the translation, the edifice close to the
Viso, instead of upon it, as in the original text. I
doubt whether any apology is necessary for this
poetical licence, by which the intention of the
proverb undergoes no alteration. It is true, a house
may be close to a hill without being erected upon
it; but if, as in this instance, it is on the top of the
hill, it is most certainly close to it likewise.</p>

<p>The submission of the Spaniards to the despotism
of etiquette and custom in trifles, does not (otherwise
than apparently) constitute a contradiction to
this independence of character. However that may
be, the breach of all other laws meets with easier
pardon, than that of the laws of custom. This code
is made up of an infinity of minute observances,
many of which escape the notice of a foreigner, until<a name="page_276" id="page_276"></a>
accustomed by degrees to the manners of those who
surround him. He will not, for instance, discover, until
he has made himself some few temporary enemies,
that no greater insult can be offered to a person of
rank, or in authority, than saluting him in a cloak
<i>embozado</i>&mdash;the extremity thrown over the shoulder.&mdash;A
similar neglect is not pardoned either by the fair
sex. The minutest peculiarities in dress are observed,
and if at all discordant with the received
mode of the day, incur universal blame. The situation
of a stranger is, in fact, at first scarcely agreeable
in a country in which the smallest divergence from
established customs attracts general attention and
criticism. This does not, however, interfere with the
ready good-nature and disposition to oblige met with,
as I said before, on all occasions.</p>

<p>In some instances the attachment to external forms
operates advantageously. Such is that of the picturesque
practice prevailing in many of the provinces,
of assuming the quality of the <i>Beata</i>. In Toledo,
certain peculiarities in the toilette of one of a group
of young ladies attracted my curiosity. She was
apparently about seventeen; pretty, but by no means
remarkably so for a Spaniard, and appeared to be
in deep mourning. Whenever, in speaking, a movement
of her right hand and arm lifted up her
mantilla, a japanned leather sash was exposed to<a name="page_277" id="page_277"></a>
view, of about two inches in width, an end of which
hanging from the right side, reached rather lower
than the knee. On the right sleeve, half-way between
the shoulder and the elbow, was fixed a small
silver plate, called an <i>escudo</i>, and a rosary was worn
round her neck.</p>

<p>I was informed, on inquiry, that she was <i>una
beata</i>; and being still in the dark, my informant
related her story. He commenced by the inquiry,
whether I had heard of a young man being drowned
four months previously in the Tagus. I replied
that I had heard of thirty or forty; for he referred
to the bathing season, during which, as the river is
sown with pits and precipices, and unprovided with
humane societies, accidents occur every day. He
then named the victim, of whose death I had in fact
heard. He was a youth of the age of twenty, and
the <i>novio</i> (intended) of the young lady in black.
On hearing suddenly, and without preparation, the
fatal news, she had been seized with a profuse
vomiting of blood, and had continued dangerously ill
during several weeks. She was now convalescent, and
had made her appearance in society for the first time.</p>

<p>My informant added, on my repeating the inquiry
respecting the costume, that it is the custom for
a young lady, on recovering from a serious illness,
to offer herself to the <i>Virgen de los dolores</i>; the<a name="page_278" id="page_278"></a>
external sign of the vow consisting in the adoption
of a dress similar to that worn by the Virgin in the
churches. The obligation assumed lasts generally
during a year; although some retain the dress for
the remainder of their life. Examples are known
of this practice among the other sex; in which case
the costume is that of a Franciscan friar; but the
<i>beato</i> becomes the object of ridicule.</p>

<p>Among the forms of society to which especial importance
is attached are the ceremonies and duration
of mourning for relations. The friends of the nearest
relative,&mdash;especially if a lady,&mdash;of a person newly
deceased, assemble day after day for a considerable
time in her house. All are in full dress of deep
mourning; and the victim of sorrow and society is
expected to maintain a continual outpouring of sighs
and tears, while she listens to each consoler in turn.
Much importance is attached to the display of the
usual appearances of grief, even when the circumstances
of the case do not necessarily call for it.
Happening to enter a house in which news had been
received of the death of a relative, who resided in
another part of Spain, I found the lady of the
house discussing with a friend the form of her new
mourning dress.</p>

<p>Struck by the melancholy expression of her countenance,
and the redness of her eyes, I inquired<a name="page_279" id="page_279"></a>
whether any bad news had been received. My
question gave rise to a renewed flood of tears; "Yes,
yes," was the reply; "I have had terrible news; my
poor uncle, who had been afflicted for years with
dropsy, died only six days ago." I expressed my
sincere regret at so sad an event, while she continued
her explanations to the other lady. "I understand,"
she said, in a voice almost suffocated, "that this
sleeve is no longer to be&mdash;drawn in; and the&mdash;front,
according to the last&mdash;French&mdash;fashion,&mdash;is at least
an inch&mdash;shorter." Taking the opportunity of the
first moment of silence, I asked for some further
details respecting this beloved uncle. "It was your
Señora mother's brother, I believe?" "No, no, the
husband of my aunt: and what&mdash;do you&mdash;think of
the&mdash;mantilla?" After the reply of the other visitor
to the latter question, I continued,&mdash;"But your
profound regret, on occasion of the loss of so amiable
a companion, is natural." "Terrible, sir, yes&mdash;my
poor uncle!" "Had you seen him shortly before the
sad event?" "Alas! no, sir, I never&mdash;saw him but&mdash;once
in my life; and&mdash;should not now have recognized
him&mdash;for I&mdash;was then&mdash;only five years old."</p>

<p>The Spaniards are not a dinner-giving nation;
obedient, as some suppose, to their proverb,&mdash;which
although the effect, may also operate as a cause,&mdash;namely,
'Feasts are given by fools, and partaken of<a name="page_280" id="page_280"></a>
"by wise men." This proverb, however, paints the
national character with less fidelity than most others;
the parsimonious selfishness it implies is not Spanish.
Sufficient reasons exist to account for the rarity
of dinner invitations.</p>

<p>Although the English are not responsible for the
geniality of climate, which corks up their crystallized
souls to be enclosed fog-tight, until released by a
symbolical ceremony of the popping of champagne
corks,&mdash;it is not the less true that dinners are their
only introductions to acquaintanceship. Spaniards
have corks also, and well worth the trouble of
drawing, as well as all the other <i>materiel</i> of conviviality;
but they despise it, finding the expansion
operated by their sunshine more complete and less
laborious. Their sociability no more requires dinner
parties than their aloes hedges do steam-pipes.
With the exception of their ungovernable passion
for cold water, their sobriety is extreme; and this
may perhaps unite with a dislike to social ostentation
in resisting the exotic fashion of dinners. But bring
a good letter of introduction to a Spaniard, and you
will find a daily place at a well-supplied table,
the frequent occupation of which will give unmistakable
pleasure.</p>

<p>In such case you are looked for as a daily visitor;
not ceremoniously, but as using the house when in<a name="page_281" id="page_281"></a>
want of a more cheerful home than your <i>posada</i>.
Æolus has not yet been appointed here the arbiter of
smiles,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and your entrance is always the signal for
the same animated welcome. The only variation
will be a good-natured remonstrance, should your
visits have undergone any interruption.</p>

<p>To return to my route. Aware of the inconvenience
of Spanish inland travelling, and with
Seville for my object, I proceeded to Lyon. Nor
had I long to wait for the reward attendant on my
choice of route. Getting on board the steam-packet
at six o'clock on an autumn morning, I experienced
at first some discouragement, from the fog, which
I had not reflected was the natural&mdash;or rather unnatural&mdash;atmosphere
of that most discouraging of
all places, a prosperous manufacturing town. No
sooner, however, had we escaped, by the aid of high-pressure
steam, from these deleterious influences, than
our way gradually opened before us, rather dimly at
first, but more and more clear as the sun attained
height: the banks of the Rhone having, during this
time, been progressing also in elevation and grandeur,
by eight o'clock we were enjoying a rapidly moving
panorama of superb scenery.</p>

<p>This day's journey turned out unusually auspicious.<a name="page_282" id="page_282"></a>
Owing to some favourable combination of
celestial influences, (although I perceived no one on
board likely to have an astrologer in his pay,) no
untoward accident&mdash;so common on this line&mdash;befell
us. No stoppages&mdash;no running down of barges, nor
running foul of bridges&mdash;nor bursting of engines.
The stream was neither too shallow, nor too full,
so that we were preserved both from running aground,
and from being run away with. Our boat was the
fastest of the six which started at the same time;
and one is never ill-disposed by a speed of eighteen
miles an hour, although it may be acquired at an
imminent risk of explosion.</p>

<p>There is many a day's journey of equal or greater
beauty than the descent of the Rhone; but I know
of none which operates a more singular effect on the
senses. It is that of being transported by a leap from
the north to the south of Europe. The Rhone
valley, in fine weather, enjoys a southern climate,
while all the region to the north of Lyon is marked
by the characteristics of the more northern provinces.
That town itself, with its smoke, its gloom,
and its dirt, maintains itself at the latitude of Manchester;
whose excellent money-making inhabitants,
if thrown in the way of a party of Lyonnais, would
scarcely feel themselves among strangers, so complete
would be the similarity of habits and manners.<a name="page_283" id="page_283"></a>
The transition, therefore, to those wafted
down the sunny valley of the Rhone, is as theatrical
as the scenery itself, but with the agreeable addition
of reality. Every surrounding object contributes
to the magic of the change. Taking leave
of a bare and treeless country, and its consequently
rough and ungenial climate, which, in its turn, will
necessarily exercise its influence on the character of
the population, you find yourself gliding between
vine-clad mountains, not black and rugged like those
of the Rhine, but soft and rosy, and lighted by a
sky, which begins here to assume a southern brilliancy.
The influence of the lighter atmosphere
first begins to be felt, expanding the organs, and
filling the frame with a sensation, unknown to more
northern climes, of pleasure derived from mere existence.
Then the language you hear on all sides
is new and musical; for the crew of the steamer
is Provençal, and their <i>patois</i> falls on the ear with
something approaching the soft accent of Italy;
while their expressive eyes, sunburnt faces, and a
certain mixture of animation and languor&mdash;the exact
counterpart of the phlegmatic industry of the
north, complete the scene, with which they are in
perfect harmony.</p>

<p><i>A propos</i> of harmony, when the sailors' dinner
hour arrived, they were summoned by an air of<a name="page_284" id="page_284"></a>
Rossini, played on a bugle; the performer&mdash;one of
their number&mdash;having first thrown himself flat on
the deck, in the attitude of a Turk about to receive
the bastinado, and then raising his chest, by the aid
of his two elbows, to the height required for the
inflation of the instrument.</p>

<p>Nor is this leap from north to south so purely
imaginary, since the boat Sirius, aided by the furious
current, actually paddled at the rate of from seventeen
to eighteen miles an hour; and we reached
Avignon at sunset, about five o'clock. The distance
being calculated, allowing for the windings
of the river, will verify the rate maintained during
the day. Notwithstanding the odious nature of
comparisons, I could not help forming that between
this river and the Rhine, and giving the preference
to the first. The bold though gloomy precipices
of the Rhine yield, in point of charm, to the more
open expanse of the Rhone valley, and the larger
scale of the scenery, especially when the far more
brilliant lighting-up is considered. Nor does the
Rhone yield to its rival, in regard to the picturesque
form and position of its castles and other
buildings; while its greater width, and handsome
bridges, add an additional feature.</p>

<p>The best scene of the day, and a fit climax for
its termination, was the approach to Avignon at<a name="page_285" id="page_285"></a>
sunset,&mdash;a superb Claude. A turn of the river
placed the castle&mdash;an immense mass crowning the
city, and presenting an irregular outline&mdash;directly between
us and the sun, the sky doing away, by its brightness,
with all the details of the landscape. The
principal objects were, the broad expanse of water,
and the mass of deep purple, tracing its dark but
soft outline on the blaze of gold at its back. On
turning to look in the opposite direction, a scene
equally striking presented itself. The mountains
between which we had been winding during the
last half of the day, are, from this point of view,
ranged in an immense semicircle, extending round
half the horizon, and at that moment were tinged
by the sun with a bright rose colour, while they
scarcely appeared at half their actual distance.
It looked like the final scene of an aërial ballet,
when a semicircle is formed by the rosy sylphs who
have figured during the representation.</p>

<p>After the hurly burly of debarkation at Avignon,
and forcing our way through the army of luggage
porters&mdash;a ferocious race, notorious, at this place,
for the energy, amounting often to violence, with
which they urge the acceptance of their kind
offices&mdash;the picturesque look of the place, and the
necessary hour of waiting for dinner, led me to a
scene, which I accepted as a satisfactory greeting<a name="page_286" id="page_286"></a>
on my arrival in the land of the troubadours. A
group of half a dozen labourers, returned from
their day's work, were lolling in every variety of
attitude, on some large stones placed in front of
the <i>château</i>. They were singing&mdash;and with perfect
precision of <i>ensemble</i>&mdash;each his part of the chorus.
At the conclusion of every <i>morceau</i>, the whole
party made the façade of the ancient palace echo
with peals of laughter; after which they all talked
at once, until they had agreed on the choice of
the succeeding air.</p>

<p>The castle of Avignon&mdash;ancient residence of
the Popes, shelters now a different sort of inmates.
It serves for barracks for a regiment of infantry.
At this moment the lamplighter had completed
his rounds in the interior, and given to each of
the innumerable windows an undue importance in
the architectural effect of the mass. Such is the
irregularity of their distribution over this vast façade&mdash;or
such it appeared to be then, for I have not
seen it by daylight&mdash;as to give them the appearance
of having been thrown at it by handfuls, and fixed
themselves each at its first point of contact with
the wall.</p>

<p>Or by way of compensation for the extravagant
supposition of so large a hand, we can suppose the
edifice diminished, and resembling with its jagged<a name="page_287" id="page_287"></a>
outline, a ragged black cloak, which, having been
stretched out, to serve as a mark for rifle-shooters,
would admit the light through openings not less
symmetrically distributed than these windows.</p>

<p>Between Avignon and Marseille, by the land
route, the only spot of interest is Aix. It is a well
placed little town; although, in the summer, its
position must procure for it rather too much warmth.
There are no remains of king Réné's palace; nor
could I learn that any souvenir of him was extant,
with the exception of a statue, which represents
the jovial old king of the <i>trouvères</i> in the character
of Bacchus. This figure ornaments a hot fountain,
situated at the head of the wide street, planted
with trees, by which the town is entered.<a name="page_288" id="page_288"></a></p>

<h3><a name="LETTER_XVI" id="LETTER_XVI"></a>LETTER XVI.</h3>

<h5>VOYAGE TO GIBRALTAR.</h5>

<p class="r">Cadiz.<br />
</p>

<p>I have just returned from a visit to the signal-tower&mdash;the
highest look-out in Cadiz; from which
is seen a panorama equalled by few in Europe.
The Atlantic, and its coast down to Trafalgar Cape&mdash;the
mountain distances of the Ronda&mdash;and Medina
Sidonia on its sugar-loaf rock, like an advanced
sentinel&mdash;all Cadiz, with its hundreds of white
Belvideres&mdash;and the bright blue bay, decked with
glittering white towns, and looking (but with more
sparkling glow) like an enormous turquoise set
round with pearls. But let not, I entreat you, these
magic words&mdash;Cadiz&mdash;Andalucia&mdash;raise your expectations
unduly; lest they be disappointed, on rinding
that I fail in doing justice to this charming country.
With regard to this town, not only would it
be a task beyond my powers to paint its bright
aspect and to give you a sufficiently glowing description<a name="page_289" id="page_289"></a>
of its pleasures. It is not even my intention
to partake of these&mdash;being bent on accomplishing
my principal object&mdash;the exploration of the monuments
of Seville. However let us not anticipate.
You ought to have had news of me from Gibraltar,
where I made a much longer stay than I had intended,
owing to an unexpected meeting with an old
friend.</p>

<p>The fact is, I put off writing until I should again
be in movement, hoping that my letters might thus
acquire greater interest. I will resume my journey
from France, in which country we parted.</p>

<p>The steam-packets leave Marseille for the south
of Spain every tenth day; and I happened to arrive
a day or two after one of the departures.
Rather than wait eight days, therefore, I agreed for
my passage on board a trader bound for Gibraltar;
by which arrangement, as the captain assured me
that the voyage would only occupy five days, I was
to be at my journey's end before the departure of
the Phénicien, as the steam-packet was called.
The latter, moreover, made no progress excepting
during the night, in order to afford the passengers
an opportunity of passing each day in some town;
and being anxious to arrive at Seville, I should not
have liked the delays thus occasioned. I do not, however,
recommend the adoption of my plan; for the<a name="page_290" id="page_290"></a>
five days, as it turned out, became twenty-four, and
the Phénicien arrived at Cadiz long before I reached
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The captain's prognostic of course supposed a
favourable voyage; and I was wrong in reckoning on
this, particularly at the time of year, and in the
Mediterranean. I was wrong, also, in confiding in
my Provençal captain, who, in addition to various
other bad qualities, turned out to be the most inept
blockhead to whom ever were entrusted lives and
cargoes.</p>

<p>My fellow-passengers consisted of a Marseille
merchant, who possessed a trading establishment at
Gibraltar; a young French officer, on leave of absence
to visit his mother, who was Spanish; and
a Moorish traveller, proceeding homeward to Tetuan.
From certain hints dropped by the merchant,
who was well acquainted with the passage, we soon
learned the probable character of our captain, as he
belonged to a race not very favourably spoken of
by those whose goods and persons they were in
the habit of conveying; and these predictions being
soon partially confirmed by the man's incivility,
we began to look upon him as our common
enemy. One of the accusations brought against
his class was, a disposition to reduce the supply
of provisions within undue limits. This, however,<a name="page_291" id="page_291"></a>
we could not lay to his charge, as the adverse
winds rendered necessary an extreme prudence in
our daily consumption. My principal anxiety arose
from want of confidence in the capacity of the
man for the performance of his duties as a seaman.
This anxiety was grounded on various symptoms
sufficiently striking to attract the notice even of a
landsman; and more particularly on a scene, during
which his presence of mind, if mind he possessed,
totally deserted him.</p>

<p>We had passed several days off the Balearic
Islands&mdash;or rather on and off&mdash;for each morning
we issued from behind Ivica, and returned at night
to take shelter under its cliffs; ours being the only
vessel of several performing the same passage restrained
by fear from attempting any progress
during these nights. The reason of this we learned
subsequently. At length, when we did risk an
advance, we chose the worst moment of all: the
breeze becoming a gale, and almost a head-wind,
from having been less unfavourable. Whatever
may now have been our anxiety, we could easily
discover that the author of our misfortune was a
prey to more terror than ourselves.</p>

<p>Against this wind we proceeded, gaining about
a hundred yards an hour, during five days; at the
end of which it changed slightly, and allowed us to<a name="page_292" id="page_292"></a>
reach the entrance of the channel; that is, we had
doubled the Cape de Gata, and were off the south
coast of the peninsula, nearly opposite Almeria,
and in the direct line of all the vessels entering
the Mediterranean; which, as they are sometimes
delayed in expectation of a favourable wind for
passing the Straits of Gibraltar, were now bearing
down in great numbers. At this crisis the gale,
which had all along continued to be violent, became
once more almost directly adverse, and increased in
fury.</p>

<p>Our gallant captain's features always assumed towards
evening a more serious expression. A faint
tinge of green was observed to replace the yellow
of his usual complexion, and he passed the nights
on deck, as unapproachable as a hyena&mdash;by the
way, also a most cowardly animal. At length one
day as evening approached, the wind was almost
doing its worst, and we went to bed tossed about
as if in a walnut-shell&mdash;lulled by an incessant roaring,
as it were, of parks of Perkin's artillery.</p>

<p>It being essential to keep a good look-out, and
to show a light occasionally, in order to avoid
being run down&mdash;the lantern&mdash;unable to live on
deck, from the water as well as the wind, which
passed through the rigging&mdash;was confided to the
passengers, with a recommendation, by no means<a name="page_293" id="page_293"></a>
likely to be neglected, to keep it in good trim, and
to hand it up with promptitude when called for.</p>

<p>At about twelve o'clock, sure enough, the call was
heard, in the somewhat agitated tones of the captain.
The passenger, whose business it was, for we took
the watch each in his turn&mdash;immediately jumped up
and handed up the lantern. Thinking this sufficient,
we remained as we were; but in less than a minute,
it was brought back extinguished, and thrown down
into the cabin. Immediately after a general view
holloa was audible above the roar of the storm, and
the mate's voice was heard at the top of our staircase,
begging us to get up as we were going to
be run down.</p>

<p>We now lost no time in making our way to the
deck; no one speaking a word, but each waiting
for his turn to mount. Being furthest from the
staircase, or rather ladder, I arrived the last. On
reaching the deck, I was met by about a ton of
salt water, which appeared to have mistaken me
for a wicket, as it came in as solid a mass, and with
about the same impulse as a cricket ball. Finding
I was not to be dashed back again down stairs, it
took the opportunity of half filling the cabin, the
door of which I had not thought of shutting. On
recovering my breath and reopening my eyes, I
discerned, by aid of the white bed-apparel of my<a name="page_294" id="page_294"></a>
fellow passengers, a dim crowd, pressed together
at the bow of the vessel, consisting of all the inhabitants
of the frail tenement, excepting the steersman
and myself. I rushed forward; but finding
my voice insufficient to add any effect to the cry
which had been set up, to give notice to the crew
of the approaching vessel, I made for the side, which
I saw, by the position of the group, was threatened
with the expected contact; and catching at a rope
ladder, placed myself on the top of the bulwarks,
resolved on trying a jump as the only chance of
escape in case of meeting.</p>

<p>There was now time to examine our situation
perfectly well. I looked towards the stern, and
could see that the helm was not deserted: but it
was of no avail to save us from the danger; since,
sailing as near the wind as we could, as far as I
understood the subsequent explanation of the sailors,
we could not change our direction on a sudden, otherwise
than by turning a sort of right-about-face. We
went on, therefore, trusting that the other crew
would hear the cry, and discover our position in
time. The night being extremely dark, and the sea
running high, the approaching vessel was scarcely
visible to us when first pointed out by the sailors;
still less should I have looked forward to its threatening
us with any danger; but the eye of experience<a name="page_295" id="page_295"></a>
had not been deceived, and from my perch I was
soon able to discover, as each passage over the summit
of a wave brought the dark mass against the sky,
that its approach was rapid, and directed with unerring
precision, so as to cross our course at the fatal
moment. She was scudding before the gale, with
almost all her sails set, and consequently, on striking
our ship, nothing could save us from an instantaneous
founder.</p>

<p>At each successive appearance the mass became
larger and blacker; but the cry of our crew, in
which I now joined, never ceased. At length we
were only separated by the ascent of one wave, at
the summit of which was balanced the huge bulk of
our antagonist, while we were far below the level of
her keel&mdash;but her steersman had heard the cry; for
at the moment when certainly no hope of saving&mdash;at
least our ship, remained to any of us, we saw the
other swerve as she descended&mdash;and after approaching
to within half her length of our starboard bow,
she glided by at the distance of a yard from where
I was standing.</p>

<p>I now drew a deep breath before I jumped down
on to the deck; after which, beginning to perceive
that I was as wet as if we had been run down, I
was hastening to the cabin, when my progress was
stopped by the captain, who, without perceiving<a name="page_296" id="page_296"></a>
any one, was stamping up and down the centre of
the vessel, and actually tearing his hair with both
his hands. I paused to observe this tragic performance,
which shortly gave place to an indistinct and
much interrupted speech, in which, in the intervals
left by all the oaths as yet invented in the French
and Languedoc tongues, there could be distinguished
dark threats of vengeance, addressed to the captain
of the large brig, whom he was to discover without
fail on his return to Marseille.</p>

<p>All the passengers now descended to the cabin,
and having stripped and rolled myself in my cloak
turned inside out, I threw myself on my couch.
We were now, in spite of recent experience, provided
with a fresh lighted lantern, to be produced
on the next call. This we took care still to look to,
although we hardly expected more than one such
chance in one night.</p>

<p>It was past two, and we had scarcely left off
discussing our narrow escape, when another rapid
and significant demand for the lantern announced
a second peril. On this occasion I took my time,
for I had reflected on the odds, which were immense,
against our being a second time so exactly in any
one's way, where there was room for the whole navigation
of the world to pass abreast. Nor could
I suspect any of my fellow-passengers of being the<a name="page_297" id="page_297"></a>
unlucky Jonas of our misfortunes; although the
Moor was looked upon by some of the sailors with
a suspicious eye, for not consenting to partake of
a leg of chicken, if the animal had been killed
and cooked by any other hand than his own,
and for the mysterious formalities they accused
him of observing in killing his poultry; such as
turning his face in a particular direction, and requiring
the blood to flow in a particular manner&mdash;on
failure of which last requisite, he threw the
fowl overboard. These things alarmed the sailors,
but helped, on the contrary, to encourage me; as
I thought the man's being possessed of a conscience
and religious scruples, rather, if any thing, an additional
safeguard for us.</p>

<p>This time, therefore, I drew on my boots and
trowsers; and, wrapped in my cloak, proceeded in
company with the Moor, who had taken it as leisurely
as myself, to join the party on deck. They
had kept the lantern in a safe position until the
moment it would have the best chance of taking
effect, a proper precaution, as it was likely to be so
short-lived. And at the moment I arrived the order
was being given to shew it ahead. A sailor took
it, and before he could reach the bow of the vessel,
a wave broke over him and washed his lantern
fairly into the sea. Upon this the captain said not<a name="page_298" id="page_298"></a>
a word, but running to the helm, took it in hand,
and turned the ship right round, presenting her stern
to the wind, and to the approaching vessel,&mdash;which
we now soon lost sight of, as we were not a slow sailing
craft in a fair wind. Having performed this masterly
feat, and given orders that no change should
be made in any respect, he went to bed; muttering
as he left the deck various indistinct sounds between
his teeth. The next morning we had undone nearly
all our six day's work, and before evening of the
following day, had returned to within sight of
Cape St. Martin near Valencia.</p>

<p>It was now a fortnight since we had quitted
Marseille, and we were nearly half-way to our place
of destination; but Neptune took pity on us, and
having given the usual scolding to Eolus, we were
allowed to resume our course, although not at as
good a rate as we could have wished. The tempest
had ceased, and by means of a feeble but fair wind
which succeeded, we regained in three days and
nights almost all our lost way, and were on the point
of doubling the Cape Gata. Here we remained
stationary in a dead calm during another three days,
after which an almost imperceptible movement in
the air in the wished-for direction bore us to within
sight of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>This progress along the southern coast lasted three<a name="page_299" id="page_299"></a>
days more, and introduced me to the climate of Andalucia.
At the end of November it was still a splendid
summer&mdash;but with just sufficient air to prevent
our suffering from the heat. The blue Mediterranean
at length vindicated her fair fame, and proved that
one of her smiles had the power of throwing oblivion
over all the harm of which she was capable during her
moments of fretfulness. As you will easily imagine,
I passed these delicious days, and nearly the entire
nights on deck. Our view consisted of the magnificent
precipices which terminate, at the shore, the
Alpuxarras chain of mountains. These are coloured
with the various tints peculiar to the ores and
marbles of which they are formed; and now showed
us all their details, although we never approached
within twenty-five miles off shore. The purity of
the atmosphere added to their great elevation, gave
them the appearance of being only four or five miles
distant. The only means of proving the illusion
consisted in directing the telescope along the line
of apparent demarcation between the sea and the
rock, when the positions of the different towns
situated on the shore were indicated only by the
tops of their towers. Among others, the tower of
Malaga Cathedral appeared to rise solitarily from the
water, the church and town being hidden by the
convexity of the sea's surface.<a name="page_300" id="page_300"></a></p>

<p>With the bright blue sea for a foreground, varied
by continually passing sails, these superb cliffs
formed the second plan of the picture; while over
them towered the Granada mountains of the Sierra
Nevada, cutting their gigantic outlines of glittering
snow out of the dark blue of the sky, at a distance of
twenty leagues. The evenings more particularly
possessed a charm, difficult to be understood by the
thousands of our fellow creatures, unable to kill that
fragment of time without the aid of constellations
of wax-lights, and sparkling toilettes,&mdash;not to mention
the bright sparks which conversation sometimes,
but not always, sprinkles o'er the scene. Now I do
not pretend to speak with disrespect of <i>soirées</i>, nor
even of balls or ra-outes, as our neighbours say;
Polka forfend I should blaspheme her deity, depreciate
her loudly laudable energies, or apostrophize
her strangely muscular hamstrings! I only maintain
that a night passed at sea, off the southern
Spanish coast in fine weather, does not yield to the
best of nights.</p>

<p>The observation of the land, of the passing sails,
and the management of our own, and the various
phenomena of sea and sky, having gradually yielded
to sunset and twilight&mdash;and these in their turn
leaving the vessel to its solitude, conversation became
amusing between people of such different origin,<a name="page_301" id="page_301"></a>
habits, and ideas, brought together by chance, drawn
nearer to each other by the force of circumstances,
and by having partaken of the same buffetings. The
Moor would then offer a cup of his coffee, or rather,
according to the Oriental custom, a thimbleful
of his quintessence of that exquisite berry. Our
French ensign was a tolerable musician, and was
easily prevailed on to unpack his cornet-à-piston,
and to astonish the solitude of the night, and the
denizens of the deep, by the execution of the
favourite airs of Auber and Halevy. Sometimes a
bark too distant to be visible would hail us on
hearing these unusual strains; and faint sounds of
applause would arrive as if from wandering naiads.</p>

<p>At length one afternoon brought us in sight of
Gibraltar. And now, lest we should arrive without
further mishap, our precious Provençal took care to
give us a parting proof of his incapacity,&mdash;which
however, thanks to our good fortune, did not bring
upon us the annoyance it threatened. The rock
of Gibraltar was before us the whole of the following
day; but there appeared also in sight, somewhat to
its left, and at a much greater distance, a sort of
double mountain, apparently divided from the middle
upwards by a wedge-formed cleft. The captain
replied to all questions by describing this object
as consisting of two distinct mountains, which he<a name="page_302" id="page_302"></a>
pronounced to be no others than the two Pillars of
Hercules,&mdash;promising us that the next morning we
should see them separated by the entire width of
the Straits.</p>

<p>Far from suspecting the authenticity of this explanation,
I innocently inquired what was the large
rock (Gibraltar itself) apparently much nearer to us.
"Oh!" he replied, "it was some promontory on the
coast of Andalucia, the name of which had escaped
his memory;" adding that we steered very slightly
to the left of the said rock, because the wind having
increased, and blowing off shore, we could not make
Gibraltar otherwise than by keeping well into the
shore, to prevent our being driven towards Africa.
All this about the wind was so true, that had we
preserved to the last the direction we were then
following, we must inevitably have gone to Africa,
and added a day and a night to our voyage.</p>

<p>The Marseille merchant, who had made the voyage
twenty times, listened to all this; but although very
intelligent on most subjects, and more particularly
with regard to the qualities and value of silks and
quincaillerie, his notions of practical geography had
not probably attained any great development, as he
appeared perfectly satisfied. I therefore passed the
day and retired that night filled with curiosity
respecting this remarkable promontory, that had<a name="page_303" id="page_303"></a>
escaped the notice of Arrowsmith and the continental
geographers. The following morning, to
my extreme astonishment, the double mountain was
still as undivided as ever, notwithstanding our
having approached so near to the great rock as to
distinguish its colour, and the details of its surface.
We were still steering so as to leave it behind us.</p>

<p>I now began to suspect something was wrong; and
getting hold of the merchant, proceeded to question
him closely, recalling to his recollection the captain's
explanation of the previous day, and the consequent
miraculous union of Gibraltar with the mountain
of the monkies, to accomplish which the former must
have quitted Europe subsequently to the publication
of the last newspapers we had seen at Marseille.
His replying that he certainly thought the great
rock put him in mind of Gibraltar confirmed my
suppositions; and I prevailed upon him to repeat his
opinion to the ignoramus, who was peaceably eating
his breakfast on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck.
We went to him instantly, and on hearing the remark,
he merely observed that it was very possible;
and leaving his sausage, quietly proceeded to the
helm, which he no more quitted until we were in the
bay at four in the afternoon. We had only lost
about five or six hours by the blunder; but had we<a name="page_304" id="page_304"></a>
continued the same course another half-hour, we
could not possibly have made Gibraltar that day.</p>

<p>It was with more than the ordinary excitement of
the organ of travelling,&mdash;for if phrenology deserves
to be called a science, such an organ must exist,&mdash;that
I approached this great Leviathan of the seas;
perhaps, all causes considered, the most remarkable
object in Europe. During the approach the interest
is absorbing; and the two or three hours employed
in passing round the extremity of the rock, and
stretching sufficiently far into the Straits, to gain
wind and channel for entering the bay, slipped away
more rapidly than many a ten minutes I could have
called to my recollection. The simultaneous view of
Europe and Africa; the eventful positions with
which you are surrounded,&mdash;Tarifa, Algeciras, and
further on Trafalgar; the very depths beneath you
too shallow for the recollections which crowd into
this limited space; commencing with history so
ancient as to have attained the rank of fable,&mdash;and
heroes long since promoted to demi-gods; and reaching
to the passage of the injured Florinda, so quickly
responded to by that of Tharig, followed by a
hundred Arab fleets. The shipping of all nations
continually diverting the attention from these
<i>souvenirs</i>; and, crowning all, the stupendous mass of
the now impregnable rock.<a name="page_305" id="page_305"></a></p>

<p>Amidst all this, I could not drive from my
thoughts the simple and patriotic old Spanish historian
de Pisa, and the operation to which he attributes
the origin of this mountain. From him may
be learned all the details respecting this work of
Hercules; as to which, as well as to the motives
of its fabricator, the poets of antiquity were in the
dark. Hercules had been induced, by the high
reputation of Spain, of her population, and her various
natural advantages, to conduct thither an army
for the purpose of taking possession of the country.
After having put his project in execution, he remained
in Spain, and enjoyed a long and prosperous
reign. The victory, which gave him possession of the
country, took place at Tarifa; and it was in its
commemoration and honour that before he established
the seat of government at Toledo, he assembled
the conquered population, and compelled them
to throw stones into the sea, by which means, in
a short time, this monument was completed.</p>

<p>Before we set foot on this imperceptible trophy
of a league in length by two thousand feet high
the French ensign and myself hailed a steamer as
we passed by her in the offing, and found she was
bound for Cadiz, and we must go on board the
following afternoon. On landing, however, my projects
underwent a change, as I told you at the<a name="page_306" id="page_306"></a>
commencement of my letter. There is not much
to be seen at Gibraltar that would interest you,
except indeed the unique aspect and situation of
the place. To military men its details offer much
interest. There is a large public garden on the
side of the mountain, between the town, which
occupies the inmost extremity, and the Governor's
house near the entrance of the bay. The batteries
constructed in the rock are extremely curious, and
calculated to embarrass an enemy whose object
should be to dismount them. I thought, however,
with deference to those conversant with these subjects,
that they were likely to possess an inconvenience&mdash;that
of exposing to suffocation the gunners
employed in the caverns, out of which there
does not appear to exist sufficient means of escape
for the smoke.</p>

<p>The most amusing sight in Gibraltar is the
principal street, filled, as it is, with an infinitely
varied population. Here you see, crowded together
as in a fair, and distinguished by their various costumes,&mdash;the
representatives of Europe, Asia, and
Africa,&mdash;Arabs, Moors, Italians, Turks, Greeks, Russians,
English, and Spaniards, Jews, and, occasionally,
a holy friar conversing with some Don Basilio,
appearing, in his long cylindrical hat, as if blessed
with a skull sufficiently hard to have entered the side<a name="page_307" id="page_307"></a>
of a tin chimney-top, precipitated upon it by a gust
of wind.</p>

<p>Among all these a successful guess may here and
there be risked at the identity of the Andalucian
leader of banditti, lounging about in search of useful
information. The contrabandistas are likewise
in great plenty.<a name="page_308" id="page_308"></a></p>

<h5>CADIZ. ARRIVAL AT SEVILLE.</h5>

<p class="r">Seville.<br />
</p>

<p>Cadiz is the last town in Europe I should select
for a residence, had I the misfortune to become
blind. One ought to be all eyes there. It is the
prettiest of towns. After this there is no more to be
said, with regard, at least, to its external peculiarities.
It possesses no prominent objects of curiosity.
There is, it is true, a tradition stating it to have
possessed a temple dedicated to Hercules; but this
has been washed away by the waves of the ocean,
as its rites have been by the influx of succeeding
populations. Nothing can be more remote from
the ideas of the visitor to Cadiz, than the existence
of anything antique; unless it be the inclination
to prosecute such researches: the whole place is
so bright and modern looking, and pretty in a
manner peculiar to itself, and unlike any other
town,&mdash;since, like everything else in Spain, beauty also<a name="page_309" id="page_309"></a>
has its originality. Nothing can be gayer than the
perspective of one of the straight, narrow streets.
On either side of the blue ribbon of sky, which
separates the summits of its lofty houses, is seen
a confusion of balconies, and projecting box-windows,&mdash;all
placed irregularly&mdash;each house possessing only
one or two, so as not to interfere with each other's
view, and some placed on a lower story, others on
a higher; their yellow or green hues relieving the
glittering white of the façades. Nor could anything
improve the elegant effect of the architectural
ornaments, consisting of pilasters, vases, and
sculpture beneath the balconies, still less, the animated
faces&mdash;the prettiest of all Spain, after those of Malaga&mdash;whose
owners shew a preference to the projecting
windows, wherever a drawing-room or boudoir possesses
one.</p>

<p>The pavement of these elegant little streets, is
not out of keeping with the rest. It would be a
sacrilege to introduce a cart or carriage into them.
A lady may, and often does, traverse the whole
town on foot, on her way to a ball. It is a town
built as if for the celebration of a continual carnival.
Nor does the charge brought against the Gaditanas,
of devotion to pleasure, cause any surprise: were
they not, they would be misplaced in Cadiz. Hither
should the victim of spleen and melancholy direct<a name="page_310" id="page_310"></a>
his steps. Let him choose the season of the carnival.
There is reason to suspect that the advertiser in the
Herald had this remedy in view, when he promised a
certain cure to "clergymen and noblemen, who suffer
from blushing and despondency, delusion, thoughts
of self-injury, and groundless fear:" these symptoms
being indications of an attack of that northern
epidemy, which takes its name from a class of
fallen angels of a particular hue.</p>

<p>In Cadiz, in fact, does Carnival&mdash;that modern
Bacchus of fun, give a loose to his wildest eccentricities&mdash;nor
may those who are least disposed to do
homage to the god escape his all-pervading influence.
All laws yield to his, during his three days of Saturnalia.
Not the least eccentric of his code is that one,
which authorizes the baptism of every passenger in
a street with the contents of jugs, bestowed from
the fair hands of vigilant angels who soar on the
second-floor balconies. The statute enjoins also
the expression of gratitude for these favours, conveyed
with more or less precision of aim, in the
form of hen's eggs&mdash;of which there is consequently
a scarcity on breakfast-tables on the mornings of
these festive days. At eleven o'clock each night,
four spacious buildings scarcely suffice for the masquerading
population.</p>

<p>But the paddles have been battering for some<a name="page_311" id="page_311"></a>
hours the waters of the Guadalquivir, and we are
approaching Seville, a city given to less turbulent
propensities&mdash;where Pleasure assumes a more timid
gait, nor cares to alarm Devotion&mdash;a partner with
whom she delights, hand in hand, to tread this
marble-paved Paradise. The passage between Cadiz
and Seville, is composed of two hours of sea, and
eight or nine of river. The beautiful bay, and its
white towns, with Cadiz itself, looking in the
sunshine like a palace of snow rising out of the
sea&mdash;have no power now to rivet the attention, nor
to occupy feelings already glowing with the anticipation
of a sail between the banks of the Guadalquivir.
A ridge of hidden rocks lengthens the approach,
compelling the pilot to describe a large semicircle,
before he can make the mouth of the river. This
delay is a violent stimulant to one's impatience.
At length we have entered the ancient Betis; and
leaving behind the active little town of St. Lucar,
celebrated for its wines, and for those of the neighbouring
Xeres, of which it embarks large quantities&mdash;we
are gliding between these famous shores.</p>

<p>Great, indeed, is the debt they owe to the stirring
events that have immortalized these regions, for they
are anything but romantic. Nothing can be less picturesque;&mdash;all
the flatness of Holland, without the
cultivation, and the numerous well-peopled villages,<a name="page_312" id="page_312"></a>
which diminish the monotonous effect. On the
right are seen at some distance the wooded hills
of Xeres; but for scores of miles, on the opposite
side, all is either marsh, or half-inundated pasture,
with here and there some thinly-scattered olive
trees, and herds of oxen for its sole living occupants.
At a few leagues from Seville, the increased frequency
of the olive grounds&mdash;a few villages and
convents, and at length the darker green masses of
the orange groves, give rapidly strengthening indications
of approaching civilization; and you are
landed a short distance below the town, to reach
which, it is necessary to traverse the Christina
Gardens. The cathedral occupies this southern
extremity of the city; and on your way to the
inn, you may make an estimate of the length of
one side of its immense quadrangular enclosure.
Immediately beyond this you are received into
the inevitable labyrinth of crooked lanes, peculiar
to an Arab town.</p>

<p>The steam trip from Cadiz is so easy a day's
journey, that no necessity for repose or refitting
interferes with the impatience of those who arrive
to explore the external town. You speedily, therefore,
sally forth, and thread a few of the mazy
streets; but without venturing too far, on account
of the evident risk of losing your way. Should<a name="page_313" id="page_313"></a>
you chance to stumble on the Plaza Mayor,&mdash;called
Plaza de San Francisco,&mdash;you are at once rewarded
by the view of the <i>ayuntamiento</i>, one of the most
elegant edifices in Spain: otherwise the extreme
simplicity of the bare, irregular, but monotonous
white houses, will create disappointment&mdash;you will
stare about in the vain search of the magnificence,
so much extolled, of this semi-Moorish capital,
and discover, that nothing can be plainer, more
simple, more ugly, than the exterior of the Seville
habitations. At length, however, some open door,
or iron grille, placed on a line with an inner court,
will operate a sudden change in your ideas, and
afford a clue to the mystery. Through this railing,
generally of an elegant form, is discovered a delicious
vista, in which are visible, fountains, white
marble colonnades, pomegranate and sweet lemon-trees,
sofas and chairs (if in summer), and two or
three steps of a porcelain staircase.</p>

<p>You now first appreciate the utility of the more
than plain exteriors of the houses of this town; and
you admire an invention, which adds to the already
charming objects, composing the interior of these
miniature palaces, a beauty still greater than that
which they actually possess, lent by the effect of contrast.
It is calculated that there are more than eighty
thousand white marble pillars in Seville. For this<a name="page_314" id="page_314"></a>
luxury the inhabitants are indebted in a great measure
to the Romans, whose town, Italica, seated, in
ancient times, on the opposite bank of the river, four
miles above Seville, and since entirely buried, furnished
the Arab architects with a considerable portion
of their decorating materials.</p>

<p>In a future letter I hope to introduce you to the
interior of some of these abodes, where we shall discover
that their inhabitants prove themselves not unworthy
of them, by the perfect taste and conception
of civilized life, with which their mode of existence
is regulated.</p>

<h5>THE ARABS IN SPAIN. ALCAZAR OF SEVILLE.</h5>

<p class="r">Seville.<br />
</p>

<p>The chief attraction of this most interesting of
the provinces of the Peninsula, consists in the numerous
well preserved remains of Arab art. The
most sumptuous of their palaces are, it is true, no
longer in existence, nor the principal mosques, with
the exception of the metropolitan temple of Cordova:
but there remain sufficient specimens to shew,
that their architecture had attained the highest
excellence in two of the principal requisites for
excellence in that science&mdash;solidity and beauty.</p>

<p>The superiority of the Arabs in this branch of
science and taste is so striking, that all other departments
of art, as well as the customs and peculiarities
of that race, and the events of their dominion
in this country, become at once the subjects of
interest and inquiry. It is consequently very satisfactory
to discover that one can examine almost<a name="page_316" id="page_316"></a>
face to face that people,&mdash;probably the most advanced
in science and civilization that ever set foot in Europe;
so little are the traces of their influence worn
away, and so predominant is the portion of it still
discernible in the customs, manners, and race of the
population of this province, and even to a considerable
extent in their language.</p>

<p>There is something so brilliant in the career of the
Arab people, as to justify the interest excited by the
romantic and picturesque (if the expression may be
allowed), points of their character and customs.
Their civilization appears to have advanced abreast
with their conquests, and with the same prodigious
rapidity; supposing, that is, that previously to their
issuing from their peninsula, they were as backward
as historians state them to have been: a point
not sufficiently established. Sallying forth, under
the immediate successors of Mahomet, they commenced,
in obedience to the injunction of their new
faith, a course of conquest unrivalled in rapidity.
Their happy physical and mental organization, enabled
them to appropriate whatever was superior
in the arts and customs of the conquered nations;
and whatever they imitated acquired during the
process of adaptation, new and more graceful modifications.
It has been asserted that they owed
their civilization to the Greeks; and, certainly, the<a name="page_317" id="page_317"></a>
first subjected provinces being Greek, their customs
could not but receive some impression from the contact;
but it is not probable that the Greeks were
altogether their instructors in civilization. Had
such been the case their language would probably
have undergone a change, instead of continuing
totally independent of the Greek, and attaining to
greater richness. They are known to have possessed
poets of eminence before the appearance of Mahomet,
consequently before they had any communication
with the Greeks; shortly after the commencement
of their intercourse with them, they
shewed a marked superiority over them in geometry,
in astronomy, architecture, and medicine, and it
would probably be found, but for the destruction
of so many Arab libraries, that they did not yield to
them in eloquence and poetic genius.</p>

<p>Established in Spain, they carried the arts of
civilization&mdash;the useful no less than the elegant, to
the highest perfection. They introduced principles
of agriculture adapted to the peculiarities of the
country. The chief requisite for a country, parched
by a cloudless sun, being water&mdash;they put in practice
a complete system of irrigation, to which the
Spaniards are still indebted for the extraordinary
fertility of their soil. Many other arts that have
since been permitted to dwindle into insignificance,<a name="page_318" id="page_318"></a>
and some altogether to disappear, were bequeathed
by them. The Morocco preparation of leather is an
instance of these last.</p>

<p>Their high chivalry, added to their moderation
after victory, would have divested even war of much
of its barbarism, had they had to do with a race
less impenetrable, and more susceptible of polish
than were the iron legions of their Gothic antagonists.
The persevering and repeated acts of treachery
practised by these, at last drew their civilized
adversaries, forcibly into the commission of acts of
a similar nature&mdash;it being frequently necessary in
self-defence to adopt the same weapons as one's
enemy. When firmly settled in Spain, the Arabs
no longer appear to have taken the field with a
view to conquest. Abderahman the First, Almansor,
and other conquerors, returned from their victories
to repose in their capital; contenting themselves
with founding schools and hospitals to commemorate
their successes, without making them instrumental
to the increase of their domination. After this time
campaigns seem frequently to have been undertaken
from motives of emulation, and for the purpose of
affording them opportunities for a display of their
prowess, and giving vent to their military ardour.
They considered an irruption on the hostile territory,
or an attack on a town, in the light of a tournament.<a name="page_319" id="page_319"></a>
The Christians, on the contrary, fought
with a view to exterminate, and without ever losing
sight of their main object&mdash;the expulsion of the
Arabs and Moors from the Peninsula. It was thus
that they ultimately succeeded&mdash;a result they probably
would not have attained, had the Moorish
leaders been actuated by similar views, and displayed
less forbearance.</p>

<p>Much of the misapprehension which exists in
Europe respecting this race is attributable to the
exaggerations of writers; much more to the absence
of reflection in readers, and to the almost universal
practice of bringing every act related of personages
inhabiting remote and half-known climes, to
the test of the only customs and manners with
which we are familiar, and which we consider, for
no other reason, superior to all others&mdash;making no
allowance for difference of education, climate, tradition,
race. An European, subjected to a similar
process of criticism, on the part of an inhabitant of
the East, would certainly not recognise his own portrait&mdash;a
new disposition of light bearing upon peculiarities,
the existence of which had hitherto been
unsuspected by their owner; and he would manifest
a surprise as unfeigned, as a Frenchman once
expressed in my hearing, on finding himself in a
situation almost parallel. Conversing on the subject<a name="page_320" id="page_320"></a>
of a play, acted in Paris, in which an Englishman
cut a ridiculous figure&mdash;a lady present remarked,
that, no doubt, in the London theatres the French
were not spared; upon which the Frenchman I
allude to&mdash;a person possessed of superior intelligence&mdash;exclaimed:
"How could that be, since there
was nothing about a Frenchman that could be
laughed at?"</p>

<p>On reading of a reprehensible act attributed to a
Mahometan, some will brand Mahometanism in general,
and of all times and places, with the commission
of the like crimes, placing the event at a distance
of a thousand leagues, or of a thousand years
from its real place and date: forgetting that power
has been abused under all religions; and that we
only hear one side of the question with respect to
all that relates to the Oriental races&mdash;our information
only reaching us through the medium of writers of
different and hostile faith. It is a singular fact that
the popular terror, which so long attached itself to
the idea of a Saracen, and which derived its origin
from the conquests of the Mahometans, has its
equivalent in certain Mahometan countries. In
some parts of the empire of Morocco, the idea of a
Christian is that of a ruffian of immense stature
and terrific features; calculated to inspire the utmost
fear in the breasts of all who approach him.<a name="page_321" id="page_321"></a>
Such is their notion of his ferocity, that one of the
emperors, Muley Ismael, in order to terrify his
refractory subjects into obedience, was in the habit
of threatening to have them eaten up by the
Christians.</p>

<p>From the inferior value set on human life by the
races of the East, we accuse them of barbarity:
forgetting, that, owing to the absence of all analogy
between our origin, races, and education, we are incompetent
to appreciate their feelings, and the motives
of their conduct, and have consequently no
right to condemn them. If we abstain from taking
our neighbour's life, we set also a proportionate value
on our own: a native of the East displays, it is
true, less veneration for his own species. Deeply
impressed with the dogmas of his religion, which
form the guide of his every day life, the habit of acting
up to the doctrines which he has been taught to
believe, diminishes his estimate of the value of temporal
life, whether that of others, or his own, which
he exposes on occasions on which we should not be
inclined to do so. He does not take life for cruelty's
sake, nor without provocation. Were he to be furnished
with Arabian accounts of the treatment of a
London or Paris hackney-coach horse, he would
think of the noble and friendly animal which carries
him to battle, and turn in disgust from such a page.<a name="page_322" id="page_322"></a></p>

<p>The system practised at Constantinople of nailing
to his door-post the ear of the culprit detected in the
employment of false weights, is, no doubt, very discordant
with our customs; but this mode of punishment
is said to be attended with such success,
as to do away almost entirely with the occasion for
it. Were it adopted in some other capitals, it would
certainly at first disfigure many a neatly adorned
entrance, and give additional occupation to painters;
but the result might possibly be a more universal
observance of the injunction contained in the eighth
commandment. As far as regards the Arabs of
Spain, it may be securely affirmed, that, during the
course of their triumphs, and long before they had
attained their highest civilization, no cruelties were
exercised by them, which came near to the barbarity
of those practised subsequently by their Christian
adversaries on victims of a different creed, when in
their power. We may instance the example set by
St. Ferdinand, who, it is said, when burning some
Moors, piously stirred up the fire himself in the
public place of Palencia.</p>

<p>It cannot, however, be denied that cases of cruelty
have occurred, and are related in history of the
Arabs, although they are rare among those of Spain;
but, if cruel, the Arab never added hypocrisy to his
cruelty. After having ravaged all Andalucia with<a name="page_323" id="page_323"></a>
fire and famine, St. Ferdinand formed the project
of proceeding to Africa the following year, in order
to attack the inhabitants of that country. His death
interrupted the course of these humane projects.
Being dropsical, and feeling his end approaching,
he called for his son Alphonso, afterwards his successor,
to whom this prince&mdash;cut off in the midst
of his thirsty longings for blood and slaughter&mdash;is
related to have given "the counsels, which the
sentiments of piety, justice, and love for mankind,
with which he was filled, inspired so great a monarch."</p>

<p>As for the degenerate modern tribes, descendants
of some of the most civilized of former days, we have
witnessed their contest, <i>pro aris et focis</i>, during the
last few years, against a sample of the Christians
of to-day: the mode of making war is perfectly
similar on both sides.</p>

<p>It is a no less curious <i>travers</i> of human nature,
from its being an almost universal one&mdash;that of
which the modern Spaniards afford an example.
They apply the term "barbarians" to the descendants
of their Moorish compatriots, although they
themselves have scarcely advanced a step in civilization
since the day that, in the public place of
Granada, Ferdinand the Catholic burned one million
five thousand Arab books, being all he could collect<a name="page_324" id="page_324"></a>
throughout Spain; showing what tremendous power
may be wielded by a single human hand, when applied
to the task of undoing. That King, by a
single signature, accomplished an act which may be
considered as equivalent to retarding, by several
centuries, the civilization of a great country,&mdash;perhaps,
even, to cutting it off from the only opportunity
it was destined to possess, during the present
ages, of arriving at the summit which the more privileged
nations are permitted to attain; while it influenced
injuriously the progress of letters, science,
and art throughout Europe. But we will no longer
allow digressions to delay our visit to the Alcazar,
where we shall find visible proof of Arab superiority,
at least, in architectural science and invention.</p>

<p>Passing to the east of the cathedral through the
large open space, on the left of which is the Archbishop's
palace, and on the right the cathedral and
exchange, the embattled outer walls of the Alcazar
stop the view in front; varied here and there with
square towers, and containing in the centre an arched
entrance. The present buildings occupy the south-eastern
corner of the ancient enclosure of the royal
residence, which comprised all the remaining space
as far as the banks of the river, passing round the
south side of the cathedral, and, in fact, including
it in its precincts&mdash;an enclosure of about a mile<a name="page_325" id="page_325"></a>
and a half in circumference. An old tower, or scrap
of wall, indicates here and there the position of the
ancient buildings, the site of which is now occupied
by two or three <i>plazuelas</i>, or squares, and several
streets communicating between them. The present
palace scarcely covers a third of the original extent.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 550px;">

<span class="caption">FAÇADE OF THE ALCAZAR, SEVILLE.</span>
</div>

<p>Having passed through the first entrance, you are
in a large square, surrounded with buildings without
ornament, and used at present as government
offices. At the opposite side another archway passes
under the buildings, and leads to a second large
court. This communicates on the left with one or
two others; one of these is rather ornamental,
and in the Italian style, surrounded by an arcade
supported on double columns, and enclosing a garden
sunk considerably below the level of the ground.
This court is approached by a covered passage, leading,
as already mentioned, from the left side of the
second large square, the south side of which&mdash;the
side opposite to that on which we entered&mdash;consists
of the façade and portal of the inner palace of all;&mdash;the
Arab ornamental portion, the residence of
the royal person.</p>

<p>At the right-hand extremity of this front is the
entrance to the first floor, approached by a staircase,
which occupies part of the building on that side of
the square, and which contains the apartments of<a name="page_326" id="page_326"></a>
the governor. The staircase is open to the air, and
is visible through a light arcade. The centre portal
of this façade is ornamented, from the ground to
the roof, with rich tracery, varied by a band of blue
and white <i>azulejos</i>, and terminating in an advancing
roof of carved cedar. Right and left, the rest of
the front consists of a plain wall up to the first floor,
on which small arcades, of a graceful design, enclose
retreating balconies and windows.</p>

<p>Entering through the centre door, a magnificent
apartment has been annihilated by two white partitions,
rising from the ground to the ceiling, and
dividing it into three portions, the centre one forming
the passage which leads from the entrance to
the principal court. Several of the apartments are
thus injured, owing to the palace being occasionally
used as a temporary lodging for the court. Passing
across the degraded hall, a magnificent embroidered
arch&mdash;for the carving with which it is covered more
resembles embroidery than any other ornament&mdash;gives
access to the great court.</p>

<p>It is difficult to ascertain what portion of this
palace belongs to the residence of the Moorish Kings,
as Pedro the Cruel had a considerable portion of it
rebuilt by Moorish architects in the same style.
The still more recent additions are easily distinguished.
One of them, in this part of the edifice,<a name="page_327" id="page_327"></a>
is a gallery, erected by Charles the Fifth, over the
arcades of the great court. This gallery one would
imagine to have been there placed with a view to
demonstrate the superiority of Arab art over every
other. It is conceived in the most elegant Italian
style, and executed in white marble; but, compared
with the fairy arcades which support it, it is clumsiness
itself. The court is paved with white marble
slabs, and contains in the centre a small basin of
the same material, of chaste and simple form,
once a fountain. The arcades are supported on
pairs of columns, measuring about twelve diameters
in height, and of equal diameter throughout. The
capitals are in imitation of the Corinthian. The
entire walls, over and round the arches, are covered
with deep tracery in stucco; the design of which
consists of diamond-shaped compartments, formed
by lines descending from the cornice, and intersecting
each other diagonally. These are indented in
small curves, four to each side of the diamond. In
each centre is a shell, surrounded by fanciful ornaments.
The same design is repeated on the inside
of the walls, that is, under the arcade, but only on
the outer wall; and this portion of the court is
covered with a richly-ornamented ceiling of Alerce,
in the manner called <i>artesonado</i>.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the court to that on which<a name="page_328" id="page_328"></a>
we entered, another semicircular arch, of equal richness,
leads to a room extending the whole length of
the court, and similar in form to that situated at
the entrance, possessing also an ornamental ceiling,
but plainer walls. The left and right sides of the
court are shorter than the others. In the centre
of the left side, a deep alcove is formed in the wall,
probably occupied in former times by a sofa or
throne: at present it is empty, with the exception,
in one corner, of a dusty collection of <i>azulejos</i> fallen
from the walls, and exposing to temptation the itching
palms of enthusiasts. At the opposite end a
large arch, admirably carved, and containing some
superb old cedar doors, leads to the Hall of Ambassadors.
This apartment is a square of about
thirty-three feet, by nearly sixty in height. It is
also called the <i>media naranja</i> (half-orange), from
the form of its ceiling.</p>

<div class="centeredimage" style="width: 361px;">

<span class="caption">GREAT COURT OF THE ALCAZAR, SEVILLE.</span>
</div>

<p>In the centre of each side is an entrance, that
from the court consists of the arch just mentioned,
forming a semicircle with the extremities prolonged
in a parallel direction. Those of the three other
sides are each composed of three arches of the horse-shoe
form, or three-quarters of a circle, and supported
by two columns of rare marbles and jasper
surmounted by gilded capitals. The walls are entirely
covered with elegant designs, executed in<a name="page_329" id="page_329"></a>
stucco, the effect of which suffers from a series of
small arches, running round the upper part of the
room, having been deprived of their tracery to make
room for the painted heads (more or less resembling)
of the kings of Spain, Goths and their successors,
excepting the Arabs and Moors. This degradation
is, however, forgotten from the moment
the eye is directed to the ceiling.</p>

<p>In the Arab architecture, the ornament usually
becomes more choice, as it occupies a higher elevation;
and the richest and most exquisite labours of
the artist are lavished on the ceilings. The designs
are complicated geometrical problems, by means of
which the decorators of that nation of mathematicians
and artists attained to a perfection of ornament
unapproached by any other style. From the
cornice of this room rise clusters of diminutive gilded
semi-cupolas, commencing by a single one, upon
which two are supported, and multiplying so rapidly
as they rise, some advancing, others retreating, and
each resting on a shoulder of one below, that, by
the time they reach the edge of the great cupola,
they appear to be countless. The ornament of this
dome consists of innumerable gilt projecting bands,
of about two inches in width; these intersect each
other in an infinite profusion of curves, as they
stretch over the hemispherical space. The artist,<a name="page_330" id="page_330"></a>
who would make a pencil sketch of this ceiling,
should be as deep a geometrician as the architect
who designed it.</p>

<p>On quitting the Hall of Ambassadors, we arrive
at the best part of the building. Passing through
the arcade at the right-hand side, a long narrow
apartment is crossed, which opens on a small court
called the Court of Dolls (Patio de los Muceñas).
No description, no painting can do justice to this
exquisite little enclosure. You stand still, gazing
round until your delight changes into astonishment
at such an effect being produced by immoveable
walls and a few columns. A space, of about twenty
feet by thirty,&mdash;in which ten small pillars, placed
at corresponding but unequal distances, enclose a
smaller quadrangle, and support, over a series of
different sized arches, the upper walls,&mdash;has furnished
materials to the artist for the attainment
of one of the most successful results in architecture.
The Alhambra has nothing equal to it. Its two
large courts surpass, no doubt, in beauty the principal
court of this palace; but, as a whole, this residence,
principally from its being in better preservation
and containing more, is superior to that of
Granada, always excepting the advantage derived
from the picturesque site of the latter. The Court
of Dolls, at all events, is unrivalled.<a name="page_331" id="page_331"></a></p>

</div>

<p>The architect made here a highly judicious use
of some of the best gleanings from Italica, consisting
of a few antique capitals, which, being separated
from their shafts, have been provided with others,
neither made for them, nor even fitted to them.<a name="page_332" id="page_332"></a>
The pillars are small, and long for their diameter,
with the exception of the four which occupy the
angles, which are thicker and all white. The rest
are of different coloured marbles, and all are about
six feet in height. The capitals are of still smaller
proportions; so that at the junction they do not
cover the entire top of the shaft. This defect, from
what cause it is difficult to explain, appears to add
to their beauty.</p>

<p>The capitals are exquisitely beautiful. One in
particular, apparently Greek, tinged by antiquity
with a slight approach to rose colour, is shaped, as
if carelessly, at the will of the sculptor; and derives
from its irregularly rounded volutes and uneven
leaves, an inconceivable grace. The arches are of
various shapes, that is, of three different shapes
and dimensions, and whether more care, or better
materials were employed in the tracery of the walls
in this court, or for whatever other reason, it is in
better preservation than the other parts of the palace.
It has the appearance of having been newly executed
in hard white stone.</p>

<p>Through the Court of Dolls you pass into an
inner apartment, to which it is a worthy introduction.
This room has been selected in modern times,
as being the best in the palace, for the experiment
of restoring the ceiling. The operation has been<a name="page_333" id="page_333"></a>
judiciously executed, and produces an admirable
effect. The design of this ceiling is the most tasteful
of the whole collection. Six or seven stars
placed at equal distances from each other, form
centres, from which, following the direction of the
sides of their acute angles, depart as many lines;
that is, two from each point; or, supposing the star
to have twelve points&mdash;twenty-four from each star:
but these lines soon change their directions, and
intersecting each other repeatedly, form innumerable
small inclosures of an hexagonal shape. The lines
are gilt. Each hexagonal compartment rises in
relief of about an inch and a half from the surface,
and is ornamented with a flower, painted in brilliant
colours on a dark ground.</p>

<p>The room is twenty-four feet in height by only
sixteen wide, and between sixty and seventy in
length. At the two ends, square spaces are separated
from the centre portion by a wall, advancing
about two feet from each side, and supporting an
arch, extending across the entire width. These
arches were probably furnished with curtains, which
separated at will the two ends from the principal
apartment, and converted them into sleeping retreats.
Their ornaments are still more choice than those
of the centre. With the exception of this room,
all the principal apartments, and the two courts, are<a name="page_334" id="page_334"></a>
decorated from the ground upwards to a height of
about five feet, with the <i>azulejos</i>, or mosaic of porcelain
tiles, the colours of which never lose their
brilliancy.</p>

<p>The first floor is probably an addition made
entirely subsequently to the time of the Moors.
It contains several suites of plain white-washed
rooms, and only two ornamental apartments, probably
of Don Pedro's time. These are equal to those on
the ground floor with respect to the tracery of the
walls, unfortunately almost filled with white-wash;
but their ceilings are plainer. There is a gallery
over the Court of Dolls, of a different sort from the
rest, but scarcely inferior in beauty to any part of
the edifice. The pillars, balustrades, and ceilings,
are of wood.</p>

<p>One of the last mentioned apartments has an
advantage over all the rest of the palace, derived
from its position. It opens on a terrace looking
over the antique gardens,&mdash;a view the most charming
and original that can be imagined. This
room must be supposed to have been the boudoir
of Maria Padilla,&mdash;the object of the earliest and
most durable of Pedro's attachments; whose power
over him outlived the influence of all his future
liaisons. It is indeed probable that the taste for
this residence, and the creation of a large portion<a name="page_335" id="page_335"></a>
of its beauties, are to be attributed to the mistress,
rather than to a gloomy and bloodthirsty king, as
Pedro is represented to have been, and whose existence
was totally unsuited to such a residence.
In the Court of Dolls the portion of pavement is
pointed out on which his brother Don Fadrique fell,
slaughtered, as some say, by Pedro's own hand,&mdash;at
all events in his presence, and by his order.</p>

<p>This monarch, were his palace not sufficient to
immortalize him, would have a claim to immortality,
as having ordered more executions than all the other
monarchs who ever ruled in Spain, added together.
It appears to have been a daily necessity for him;
but he derived more than ordinary satisfaction when
an opportunity could be obtained of ordering an
archbishop to the block. The see of Toledo became
under him the most perilous post in the kingdom,
next to that of his own relatives: but he occasionally
extended the privilege to other archbishopricks.
It is a relief to meet with a case of almost merited
murder in so sanguinary a list. Such may be termed
the adventure of an innocent man, who, seeing
before him a noose which closes upon everything
which approaches it, carefully inserts his neck within
the circumference.</p>

<p>This was the case of a monk, who, hearing that
Pedro, during one of his campaigns, was encamped<a name="page_336" id="page_336"></a>
in a neighbouring village, proceeded thither, and
demanded an audience. His request being immediately
granted, no doubt in the expectation of some
valuable information respecting the enemy's movements,
the holy man commenced an edifying discourse,
in which he informed Don Pedro, that the
venerabilissimo San Somebody (the saint of his village)
had passed a considerable time with him in his
dream of the previous night: that his object in thus
miraculously waiting upon him was, to request he
would go to his Majesty, and tell him, that, owing
to the unpardonable disorders of his life, it was
determined he should lose the approaching battle.
It was the unhappy friar's last sermon; for in
less than five minutes he had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>It stands to reason, that, owing to the retired
habits of this friar, a certain anecdote had never
reached his ear relative to another member of a
religious fraternity. At a period that had not long
preceded the event just related, the misconduct of
this sovereign had drawn down upon him the displeasure
of the head of the church.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The thunderbolt
was already forged beneath the arches of<a name="page_337" id="page_337"></a>
the Vatican; but a serious difficulty presented itself.
The culprit was likely to turn upon the hand employed
in inflicting the chastisement. At length
a young monk, known to a member of the holy
synod as a genius of promise, energetic and fertile
in resources, was made choice of, who unhesitatingly
undertook the mission. He repaired to Seville,
and after a few days' delay, employed in
combining his plan of operation, he got into a
boat, furnished with two stout rowers, and allowing
the current to waft him down the Guadalquivir,
until he arrived opposite a portion of the
bank known to be the daily resort of the King,
he approached the shore, and waited his opportunity.</p>

<p>At the accustomed hour the royal cavalcade was
seen to approach; when, standing up in the boat,
which was not allowed to touch the shore, he made
signs that he would speak to the party. The monkish
costume commanded respect even from royalty,
and Don Pedro reined in his horse. The monk
then inquired whether it would gratify his Majesty
to listen to the news of certain remarkable
occurrences that had taken place in the East, from
which part of the world he had just arrived. The
King approached, and ordered him to tell his story:
upon which he unrolled the fatal document, and<a name="page_338" id="page_338"></a>
with all possible rapidity of enunciation read it from
beginning to end.</p>

<p>Before it was concluded, the King had drawn his
sword, and spurred his horse to the brink of the
water; but at his first movement the boat had pushed
off,&mdash;the reader still continuing his task,&mdash;so that
by the time Pedro found himself completely excommunicated,
his rage passing all bounds, he had
dashed into the water, directing a sabre cut, which
only reached the boat's stern. He still, however,
spurred furiously on, and compelled his horse to
swim a considerable distance; until, the animal
becoming exhausted, he only regained the shore
after being in serious danger of drowning. It may
easily be imagined that the papal messenger, satisfied
with his success, avoided the contact of terra
firma, until he found himself clear of Pedro's
dominions.</p>

<p>Quitting the room&mdash;that of Maria Padilla (according
to my conjecture) by the door which leads to
the terrace, you look down on a square portion of
ground, partitioned off from the rest by walls, against
which orange-trees are trained like our wall-fruit
trees, only so thickly that no part of the masonry
is visible. All the walls in the garden are thus
masked by a depth of about eight inches of leaves
evenly clipped. In the fruit season the effect<a name="page_339" id="page_339"></a>
is admirable. The small square portions next
to the palace thus partitioned off are laid out in
flower-beds, separated by walks of mixed brick and
porcelain, all of which communicate with fountains
in the centres. The fountains, simple and destitute
of the usual classical menagerie of marine zoology
and gods and goddesses, whose coöperation is so
indispensable in most European gardens to the
propulsion of each curling thread or gushing mass of
the cold element,&mdash;derive all their charm from the
purity and taste displayed in their design. One of
the most beautiful of them consists merely of a
raised step, covered with <i>azulejos</i>, enclosing a space
of an hexagonal form, in the centre of which the
water rises from a small block of corresponding form
and materials. The mosaic is continued outside the
step, but covers only a narrow space.</p>

<span class="caption">FOUNTAINS AT THE ALCAZAR.</span>
</div>

<p>The terrace stretches away to the left as far as the<a name="page_340" id="page_340"></a>
extremity of the buildings, the façade of which is
hollowed out into a series of semicircular alcoves;
there being no doors nor windows, with the exception
of the door of the room through which we issued.
The alcoves are surrounded with seats, and
form so many little apartments, untenable during
the summer, as they look to the south, but forming
excellent winter habitations. Arrived at the extremity
of the palace front, the promenade may be
continued at the same elevation down another whole
side of the gardens, along a terrace of two stories,
which follows the outer enclosure. This terrace is
very ornamental. From the ground up to a third of
its height, its front is clothed with the orange-tree,
in the same manner as the walls already described.
Immediately above runs a rustic story of large projecting
stones, which serves as a basement for the
covered gallery, or lower of the two walks. This
gallery is closed on the outside, which is part of
the town wall. The front or garden side is composed
of a series of rustic arches, alternately larger
and smaller, formed of rugged stones, such as are
used for grottoes, and of a dark brown colour&mdash;partly
natural, partly painted.</p>

<p>The arches are supported by marble columns,
or rather fragments of columns,&mdash;all the mutilated antique
trunks rummaged out of Italica. For a shaft<a name="page_341" id="page_341"></a>
of insufficient length a piece is found of the dimensions
required to make up the deficiency, and placed
on its top without mortar or cement. Some of the
capitals are extremely curious. Among them almost
every style may be traced, from the Hindoo to the
Composite: but no one is entire, nor matched with
any part of the column it was originally destined to
adorn. Over this gallery is the open terrace, which
continues that of the palace side on the same level.
The view extends in all directions, including the
gardens and the surrounding country; for we are
here at the extremity of the town. At the furthest
end the edifice widens, and forms an open saloon,
surrounded with seats, glittering with the bright hues
of the <i>azulejos</i>.</p>

<p>From these terraces you look down on the portion
of the garden in which the royal arms are represented,
formed with myrtle-hedges. Eagles, lions, castellated
towers,&mdash;all are accurately delineated. Myrtle-hedges
are also used in all parts of the gardens as
borders to the walks. It is a charming evening's
occupation to wander through the different enclosures
of these gardens, which, although not very extensive,
are characterised by so much that is uncommon in
their plan and ornaments, that the lounger is never
weary of them. Nor is the visible portion of their
attractions more curious than the hidden sources of<a name="page_342" id="page_342"></a>
amusement and&mdash;ablution, by means of which an
uninitiated wanderer over these china-paved walks,
may be unexpectedly, and more than necessarily refreshed.
By means of a handle, concealed&mdash;here in
the lungs of some bathing Diana in the recesses of
her grotto&mdash;here in the hollow of a harmless looking
stone&mdash;an entire line of walk is instantaneously converted
into a stage of hydraulics&mdash;displaying to the
spectator a long line of embroidery, composed of thousands
of silver threads sparkling in the sunshine, as
issuing from unseen apertures in the pavement they
cross each other at a height of a few feet from the
ground, forming an endless variety of graceful curves.
Almost all the walks are sown with these <i>burladores</i>,
as they are termed.</p>

<p>A large portion of the grounds consists of an
orange-grove, varied with sweet lemon-trees. The
trees are sufficiently near to each other to afford
universal shade, without being so thickly planted as
to interfere with the good-keeping of the grass, nor
with the movement of promenading parties. In
the centre of this grove is a beautiful edifice,&mdash;a
square pavilion entirely faced, within and without,
with the <i>azulejos</i>, with the exception only of the roof.
Around it is a colonnade of white marble, enclosing
a space raised two feet above the ground, and
surrounded by a seat of the same mosaic. The<a name="page_343" id="page_343"></a>
interior is occupied by a table, surrounded with
seats.</p>

<p>The subterranean baths, called the baths of Maria
Padilla, are entered from the palace end of the garden.
They extend to a considerable distance under
the palace, and must during the summer heats, have
been a delightfully cool retreat.</p>

<p>This <i>alcazar</i> is probably the best specimen of a
Moorish residence remaining in Europe. The Alhambra
would, no doubt, have surpassed it, but for
the preference accorded by the Emperor, Charles the
Fifth, to its situation over that of Seville: owing
to which he contented himself with building a
gallery over the principal court at the latter; while
at Granada, he destroyed a large portion of the
old buildings, which he replaced by an entire Italian
palace. At present the ornamented apartments of
the Seville palace are more numerous, and in better
preservation than those of the Alhambra.</p>

<p>Both, however, would have been thrown into the
shade, had any proportionate traces existed of the
palace of Abderahman the Third, in the environs
of Cordova. Unfortunately nothing of this remains
but the description. It is among the few Arab
manuscripts which escaped the colossal <i>auto-da-fé</i> of
Ferdinand and Isabella, and would appear too
extravagant to merit belief, but for the known<a name="page_344" id="page_344"></a>
minuteness and accuracy of the Arab writers, proved
by their descriptions of the palaces and other
edifices which remain to afford the test of comparison.</p>

<p>The immense wealth lavished by these princes,
must also be taken into consideration, and especially
by the Caliphs of Cordova, who possessed a far
more extended sway than belonged to the subsequent
dynasties of Seville and Granada. According
to a custom prevalent at their court, rich presents
were offered to the sovereign on various occasions.
Among others, governors of provinces, on their
nomination, seldom neglected this practical demonstration
of gratitude. This practice is to this day
observed at the court of the Turkish Sultan, and
serves to swell the treasury in no small degree.
Abderahman the Third, having granted a government
to the brother of his favourite, Ahmed ben
Sayd, the two brothers joined purses, and offered
a present made up of the following articles&mdash;accompanied
by delicate and ingenious compliments
in verse, for the composition of which they employed
the most popular poet of the day:&mdash;Four hundred
pounds weight of pure gold; forty thousand sequins
in ingots of silver; four hundred pounds of aloes;
five hundred ounces of amber; three hundred
ounces of camphor; thirty pieces of tissue of gold<a name="page_345" id="page_345"></a>
and silk; a hundred and ten fine furs of Khorasan;
forty-eight caparisons of gold and silk, woven at
Bagdad; four thousand pounds of silk in balls;
thirty Persian carpets; eight hundred suits of armour;
a thousand shields; a hundred thousand
arrows; fifteen Arabian, and a hundred Spanish
horses, with their trappings and equipments; sixty
young slaves&mdash;forty male, and twenty female.</p>

<p>The palace near Cordova, erected by this sovereign,
was called Azarah (the Flower) after the name
of his favourite mistress. Its materials consisted
entirely of marble and cedar wood; and it contained
four thousand three hundred columns. It was
sufficiently spacious to lodge the whole court, besides
a guard of cavalry. The gardens, as was usual with
the Arabs, formed the part of the residence on
which were lavished the greatest treasures of wealth,
and the choicest inventions of taste. The fountains
were endless in number and variety. On one of the
most picturesque spots was situated an edifice called
the Caliph's Pavilion. It consisted of a circular
gallery of white marble columns with gilded capitals;
in the centre rose a fountain of quicksilver,
imitating all the movements of water, and glittering
in the sun with a brightness too dazzling for the
eye to support. Several of the saloons of this palace
were ornamented with fountains. In one, which<a name="page_346" id="page_346"></a>
bore the name of the Caliph's Saloon, a fountain of
jasper contained in the centre a golden swan of
beautiful workmanship&mdash;and over it hung from
the ceiling a pearl, which had been sent from Constantinople
as a present from the Greek Emperor
to Abderahman. The mosque of this palace surpassed
in riches, although not in size, the Aljama
of Cordova.</p>

<p>These were monuments worthy to have kings and
caliphs for architects, for such they had. There is
no doubt that the palace of Azahrah was planned
and designed by the Caliph himself; and the
founder of that dynasty, Abderahman the First, not
only designed the magnificent mosque of Cordova,
but presided daily over the progress of its erection.
Possessed, as these sovereigns were, as well as all
the well-born portion of their nation, of a highly
cultivated education, the intervals of leisure, left
them by war, were rarely thrown away in idleness.
Abderahman the First was a poet, besides being a
mathematician, an architect, and the first soldier of
his time. Some of his writings have been preserved,
and are among the Arab works collected and translated
by Condé into Spanish. The following stanzas,
addressed to a palm-tree, must be, as is always the
case, still more beautiful in the original, although
charming in the Spanish. The monarch of the<a name="page_347" id="page_347"></a>
Western Empire, after having vanquished his enemies,
and pacified his dominions,&mdash;beloved by his
subjects and by all who approached him, and possessed
of the resources of science to occupy his mind, was
nevertheless unhappy. He preferred his home in
Asia to the splendours of an imperial throne in such
a land as Andalucia. He caused a young palm-tree
to be brought from Syria, and planted in a garden
formed by him in the environs of Cordova; and it
was his delight to sit in a tower constructed in the
garden, and gaze at his tree.</p>

<p>It was to this tree he addressed the lines thus
translated:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is probable that on the occasion of the surrender
of Cordova to Ferdinand the Third, the
Moors destroyed their palace of Azarah, since they
were desirous of acting in a similar manner at
Seville, with regard to Geber's Tower. Perhaps
from disgust at the idea that a monument, the beauty
and grandeur of which had inspired them with a
sort of affection, would be, being gazed at, trodden,
and possibly disfigured, (as it turned out) by those
whom they looked upon as barbarians, and who would
not appreciate its perfection, they attempted to introduce
a clause into the conditions of the surrender
of Seville, stipulating the destruction of the tower.</p>

<p>By way of testifying to the accuracy of the
opinion they had formed of their adversaries, Saint
Ferdinand was on the point of agreeing to the
clause: when his son, afterwards his successor,
Alonso el Sabio, perhaps the only Christian present,
who felt sufficient interest in a square mass of
masonry, to care how the question was decided,<a name="page_349" id="page_349"></a>
energetically interfered, affirming that a single
brick displaced, should be paid with the lives of the
whole population.</p>

<p>This most perfect scientific monument left by
the Arabs, for the possession of which, after the
architect, Europe is indebted to Alonso the Tenth,
we will presently examine, together with the
cathedral, which was afterwards erected, so as to
include it in his plan.<a name="page_350" id="page_350"></a></p>

<h3><a name="LETTER_XIX" id="LETTER_XIX"></a>LETTER XIX</h3>

<h5>CATHEDRAL OF SEVILLE.</h5>

<p class="r">Seville.<br />
</p>

<p>We have visited the most beautiful edifice in
Seville; we are now approaching the most magnificent.
The native writers, participating somewhat
in the character attributed to the inhabitants of their
province, sometimes called the Gascony of Spain, declare
this cathedral to be the grandest in the world.
This is going too far; setting aside St. Peter's, and
the Santa Maria del Fiore, the style of which renders
the comparison more difficult, the Duomo of Milan,
of which this building appears to be an imitation,
must be allowed to be superior to it, externally at
least, if not internally. Had they ranked it as the
finest church out of Italy, they would not have been
much in error, for such it probably is.</p>

<p>No one in approaching, excepting from the west,
would imagine it to be a Gothic edifice. You perceive
an immense quadrangular enclosure, filled apparently<a name="page_351" id="page_351"></a>
with cupolas, towers, pinnacles of all sorts and styles,
but less of the Gothic than any other. These belong
to the numerous accessory buildings, subsequently
annexed to the church; such as sacristies, chapels,
chapter-hall, each subsequent erection having been
designed in a different style. The cathedral is
inaccessible on the south side, that which we first
reach in coming from the Alcazar. It is enclosed
here within a long Italian façade of about thirty to
forty feet elevation, ornamented by a row of Ionic
pilasters, supporting an elegant frieze and balustrade.
We therefore ascend the raised pavement, which,
bounded by a series of antique shafts of columns,
surrounds the whole enclosure; and having passed
down the greater part of the east end, find a small
portal close to the Giralda, which admits to the
church through the court of orange-trees. Before
we enter, we will look round on this view, which
possesses more of the Moorish character, than that
which awaits us in the interior. Some idea of the
general plan of these buildings will be necessary,
in order that you may perfectly understand our
present point of view.</p>

<p>I mentioned above, that the general enclosure
formed a square. This square, the sides of which
face the four points of the compass, is divided by a
straight line into two unequal parts, one being about<a name="page_352" id="page_352"></a>
a third wider than the other. The direction of the
line is east and west; to the south of it is the
cathedral, to the north, the Moorish court of orange-trees.
The Arab Tower, now called the Giralda,
stands in the north-east angle of the cathedral, and
the small door, through which we have just entered,
in the south-eastern angle of the court, is
close by it.</p>

<p>The court is surrounded by buildings; for besides
the church on its south side, a chapel called the Sagrario,
runs down the entire western end. The east
side and half the north are occupied by arcades,
which support the library, the gift of the son of
Columbus to the cathedral; and the remaining
half side by a sacristy. The buildings of the east
and north sides lean against the old embattled wall
on the outside. The chapel of the Sagrario to the
west is in the Italian style. Avenues of orange-trees,
and a marble fountain of a simple but choice
design, are the only objects which occupy the open
space. Throughout it reigns an eternal gloom,
maintained by the frowning buttresses and pinnacles
of the cathedral, which overhang it from the
south.</p>

<p>A small doorway, near to that by which we entered
the court, gives access to the cathedral at all
hours. On entering an almost more than twilight<a name="page_353" id="page_353"></a>
would confuse the surrounding objects, did it immediately
succeed the sunshine of Andalucia; and
were not the transition rendered gradual to the eye
by the deep shades of the orange court. As you advance
towards the centre nave, this darkness aids
in producing the effect of immensity, which is the
next idea that presents itself. In fact the enormous
elevation and width of the edifice is such as at first
to overpower the imagination, and to deprive you
of the faculty of appreciating its dimensions. It produces
a novel species of giddiness arising from looking
upwards.</p>

<span class="caption">INTERIOR OF THE CATHEDRAL, SEVILLE.</span>
</div>

<p>To arrive at the intersection of the principal nave
and transept, you traverse two side naves, both
about eighty-five feet in height, and spacious in
proportion. The centre nave is a hundred and
thirty-two feet, but rises at the quadrangle, forming
its intersection with the transept about twenty feet
higher. The ceiling here, and over the four surrounding
intercolumniations, is ornamented with
a groining of admirable richness. That of the centre
quadrangle is here and there tinged with crimson
and orange tints, proceeding from some diminutive
windows placed between the lower and upper
ceilings.</p>

<p>After having sufficiently examined the upper view,
the eye wanders over the immense vacuum of the<a name="page_354" id="page_354"></a>
transept, and rests at length on the bronze railings
which, on the east, separate you from the high-altar,
and on the west from the choir. These are superb.</p>

<p>That of the Capilla Mayor rises to an elevation of
sixty feet, and is throughout of the most elaborate
workmanship. It is the work of a Dominican monk,
who also executed the two pulpits. The choir forms,
as usual, a sort of saloon, which occupies the centre
of the church, that is, in this instance, two of the
five intercolumniations which reach from the transept
to the western portal. Passing round it, in
the direction of the western doors, where the view
is more open, the plan and style of the building
are more easily distinguished. They are remarkably
simple. The area is a quadrangle of
three hundred and ninety-eight feet by two hundred
and ninety-one, and is divided into five naves by
four rows of pillars, all of about sixty feet elevation.
The width of the centre nave and transept is fifty-nine
feet, and the whole is surrounded by chapels.
The distance between the pillars, of which there are
only eight in each row, has the effect of generalizing
the view of the whole edifice, and imparting to it
a grandeur which is not obtained in the cathedral of
Toledo, of almost equal dimensions; while the
smaller and less gaudily coloured windows shed a
more religious ray, and are preferable to those of<a name="page_355" id="page_355"></a>
Toledo, which, magnificent in themselves, attract
an undue share of the observation, instead of blending
into one perfect composition of architectural
harmony.</p>

<p>Immediately above the arches of the principal
nave and transept, at a height of about ninety
feet, runs a balustrade, the design of which consists
of a series of pointed arches. Above it are
the windows, reaching nearly to the ceiling. They
are painted in rather dark tints, and afford no more
than a sort of <i>demi-jour</i>, which at the east end decreases
to twilight. Rather more light is admitted
towards the western extremity, from some windows
of plain glass, in the lateral chapels, without which
the pictures they contain could not be viewed; but
from this end the high-altar is scarcely discernible.
The simple grandeur of this view loses nothing by
the absence of all ornamental detail: the portion
most ornamented is the pavement, composed of a
mosaic of the richest marbles. About half-way between
the portals and the choir, are inserted two
or three large slabs, bearing inscriptions; one of
them is to the memory of Christopher Columbus;
another to his son. There are no other details to
draw the attention until we visit the chapels, in
which all the treasures of art are dispersed. A
few pictures are scattered here and there around<a name="page_356" id="page_356"></a>
the eastern part of the building; all of them are
good. A large one of Zurbaran, in the north transept,
is a master-piece. It represents St. Jerome,
surrounded by an assembly of monks.</p>

<p>At the west end of the northernmost nave, the
first door opens to a vast church, called the chapel
of the Sagrario, already alluded to as forming the
western boundary of the orange-court. It is nearly
two hundred feet in length; in the Italian style;
the orders Doric and Ionic, but loaded with heavy
sculpture in the worst taste. After this a series
of chapels, of a style analogous to the body of
the edifice, succeed each other, commencing with
that of San Antonio, and continuing all round the
church. Several of them contain beautiful details
of ornament, and handsome tombs. That of the
Kings should be mentioned as an exception, with
regard to the architecture, since its style is the
<i>plateresco</i>. It contains the tombs of Alonzo the
Tenth, and his Queen Beatrix, with several others.
The most beautiful of these chapels is that of Nuestra
Señora la Antigua, situated on the south
side, below the transept. It forms a square of
about thirty feet, and rises to an elevation of upwards
of eighty. The walls are divided into stories
and compartments, and covered, as is also the ceiling,
with admirable frescos by Martinez and Rovera.<a name="page_357" id="page_357"></a>
At a side door leading to the sacristy, are two beautiful
columns of <i>verde antico</i>. The high-altar is
composed of jasper, from quarries which existed
at the distance of a few leagues from Seville.
The statues are by Pedro Cornejo; and there are
handsome tombs let into the lower part of the
walls. Four antique chandeliers, one in each corner,
are designed with uncommon grace and originality.
From the summit of a short column rises
a silver stem, from different parts of which spring
flat rods of the same metal, so slight as to bend with
the smallest weight: they are of various lengths,
and at the extremity of each waves an elegantly
formed lamp. Each of these clusters assumes a
pyramidal form, and produces a charming effect
when lighted up on days of ceremony,&mdash;from their
harmonizing with the rest of the decorations of
the chapel, no less than from the elegance of their
form.</p>

<p>Some of the chapels of this side, and east of
the transept, communicate with other buildings,
erected subsequently to the principal edifice, and
consequently not comprised in its plan, nor analogous
to its style. Thus, after passing through the chapel
called Del Mariscal, situated at the south-east of
the apse, you enter an anteroom, which leads to
the chapter-hall. The anteroom is an apartment<a name="page_358" id="page_358"></a>
of handsome proportions, covered, in the intervals
of a row of Ionic pilasters, with a series of pieces
of sculpture in white marble. The hall itself is
magnificent. It is an oval of fifty-seven feet in
length, entirely hung with crimson velvet enriched
with gold embroidery. Another of the side
chapels leads to the smaller sacristy. I call it
smaller because it is not so large as that which
adjoins the orange-court; but it is the principal
of the two. It is a superb saloon, upwards of
seventy feet in length by about sixty wide, ornamented
with a profusion of rich sculpture. The
architect was Juan de Herrera.</p>

<p>From the floor to a height of about four feet, a
spacious wardrobe, composed of large mahogany
drawers, runs down the two longer sides of the
room. These contain probably the richest collection
that exists of gold and silver embroidered
velvets and silks,&mdash;brocades&mdash;lace&mdash;scarfs and mantles
ornamented with precious stones: all these are
the ornaments belonging to altars and pulpits;
robes, trains, and vestures of different sorts, worn
on occasions of ceremony by the principal dignitaries.
The cathedral of Seville is said to surpass
all others in these ornaments.</p>

<p>In this sacristy are contained likewise the treasure
of gold and silver vessels, and basins; innumerable<a name="page_359" id="page_359"></a>
crosses, reliquaries, chalices, boxes, and candlesticks;
and, in an upright mahogany case of about twenty
feet elevation, lined with white silk, the front of
which opens like a door, stands the Custodia&mdash;a
silver ornament about sixteen feet high, including
its base. On the day of the Corpus Christi, the
Host is placed in this Custodia, and carried in procession
through Seville. The silver of which it is
composed weighs seven hundred weight. But it
must not be supposed from this circumstance that
the ornament has a heavy appearance. It is a tapering
edifice containing four stories, ornamented by as
many orders of architecture. The general form is
circular, diminishing up to the summit, which supports
a single statue. Each story rests on twenty-four
columns, most of which are fluted, and all, together
with their capitals, remarkable for their delicacy
of finish. Among these are numerous statues of
saints, in whose costumes precious stones are introduced.
In that of the statue of Faith, which stands
in the centre of the lower story, are some of immense
value. This ornament was the work of Juan
de Arfe, the Cellini of Spain.</p>

<p>But the pictures are the richest treasure of this
apartment. It is an epitome of the Cathedral, which
may be called a gallery&mdash;one of the richest that
exists&mdash;of the paintings of Spanish schools: consequently,<a name="page_360" id="page_360"></a>
according to the opinion of many&mdash;one
of the best of all galleries. The pictures are not in
great numbers, but they are well adapted to their
situation, being the largest in dimension, and among
the most prominent in value and merit, that have
been produced by their respective painters.</p>

<p>By the greater portion of spectators, the Spanish
artists, of what may be called the golden age of
painting, will always be preferred to the Italian;
because their manner of treating their subject,
appeals rather to the passions than to the understanding.
It is the same quality which renders
the Venetian school more popular than the other
schools of Italy; and the Italian music more attractive
than the German&mdash;Rossini than Spohr or
Beethoven. I do not mean that the preference will
be the result of choice, in an individual who appreciates
the two styles perfectly; but that the difference
I allude to renders the works of the
greatest masters of Italy less easily understood.</p>

<p>With all the intelligence and taste necessary for
the appreciation of a picture of Raffaelle, many
will have had a hundred opportunities of studying
such a picture, and will nevertheless have passed
it by, scarcely noticed; merely, because on the
first occasion of seeing it, they have not immediately
caught the idea of the artist, nor entered<a name="page_361" id="page_361"></a>
sufficiently into his feelings to trace the sparks of
his inspiration scattered over the canvass. How
many are there too careless to return to the
charge, and thus to acquire the cultivation necessary
to enable them to judge of such works, who
the moment a Murillo, or a Zurbaran meets their
view, will gaze on it with delight, for the simple
reason, that it is calculated to strike the intelligence
the least cultivated.</p>

<p>The Spanish artists usually endeavoured to produce
an exact imitation of material nature; while
the Italians aimed at, and attained higher results.
The object of the Spaniards being less difficult of
attainment, the perfection with which they imitated
nature passes conception. To that they devoted
all the energies of their genius; while you may
search in vain in the best productions of Italy,
not excepting the school of Venice, the one that most
resembles the Spanish,&mdash;for anything approaching
their success in that respect. By way of an example,
in the Spasimo of Raffaelle, we trace the operations
of the mind, as they pierce through every
feature of every countenance, and the attitude of
every limb throughout the grouping of that great
master-piece of expression; from the brutal impatience
of the one, and the involuntary compassion
of the other executioner, up to the intensity of<a name="page_362" id="page_362"></a>
maternal suffering in the Virgin, and the indescribable
combination of heaven and earth, which
beams through the unequalled head of the Christ;
but there is no deception to the eye. No one
would mistake any of the figures for reality; nor
exclaim that it steps from the canvass; nor does
any one wish for such an effect, or perceive any
such deficiency.</p>

<p>What, on the contrary, was the exclamation of
Murillo before Campana's Descent from the Cross?
This master-piece of Pedro de Campana is seen
at the head of the sacristy of the cathedral. It was
so favourite a picture with Murillo, that he used
to pass much of his time every day, seated before
it. On one occasion, his presence being required
on an affair of importance, which he had forgotten,
his friends found him at his usual post before the
Descent; when, pointing to the figure of the Christ,
he replied to their remonstrances, "I am only
waiting until they have taken him down."</p>

<p>Although Murillo admired this perfect representation
of material nature, his own works are exceptions,
in fact almost the only exceptions, to this
peculiarity of the Spanish masters. He partakes,
indeed, of the qualities of both schools in an eminent
degree. In intellectual expression and delineation
of the operations of the mind, he is superior to<a name="page_363" id="page_363"></a>
all his countrymen, but inferior to the first Italian
painters. In the material imitation of nature, he
is superior to the greater number of the Italians, but
inferior to the other principal Spanish artists. There
is, at Madrid, a Christ on the Cross, of his, in which he
has attempted this effect&mdash;an effort he ought rather to
have despised. The picture contains no other object
than the figure, and the cross of admirably imitated
wood, on a simple black, or rather dark brown
background, representing complete darkness. After
sitting a short time before it, you certainly feel a
sort of uncomfortable sensation, caused by the
growing reality of the pale and tormented carcass;
but it is not to be compared to the Descent of
Campana. There the whole group is to the life,
and no darkness called in to aid the effect. The
drooping body is exposed to a powerful light, and
hangs its leaden weight on the arms of those who
support it, with a reality perfectly startling.</p>

<p>This picture is placed in the centre of the upper
end of the sacristy, as being considered the best
of those therein contained: but it is not without
rivals. The few paintings placed here are first rate;
particularly the portraits of the two archbishops
of Seville, San Leandro, and San Isidore&mdash;two of
Murillo's most exquisite productions. Some of the
greatest compositions of this painter are contained<a name="page_364" id="page_364"></a>
in the chapels we have passed in review, where
they serve for altar-pieces, each filling an entire
side of a chapel. Of these large pictures, I think
the best on the side we are visiting is the Saint
Francis. The Saint is represented kneeling to a
vision of the Virgin. It may certainly be ranked
among Murillo's best efforts in the style he employed,
when treating these celestial subjects, and
which has been called his vaporous manner. To
speak correctly, two of his three manners are employed
in this picture, since the Saint is an instance
of that called his warm manner.</p>

<p>On the opposite or north side of the cathedral,
in the first chapel after passing the door of the Sagrario,
is the San Antonio. This is probably the
greatest work of Murillo in the two styles just mentioned,
and certainly the most magnificent picture
contained in the cathedral. On the lower foreground
is the Saint, in adoration before the Christ,
who appears in the centre, surrounded by the Heavenly
Host.</p>

<p>No one but Murillo could ever have thus embodied
his conception of a supernatural vision. On
sitting down before this canvass, from which, as it
extends across the whole chapel, no other object
can draw off the attention, you speedily yield to
the irresistible power of abstraction, and are lost<a name="page_365" id="page_365"></a>
in an ecstacy, nearly resembling that which the
artist has sought to represent in the countenance
and attitude of his Saint. The eye wanders in a
sort of trance through the glorious assemblage of
Heaven. The whole scene looks real: but it is only
on taking time to study the details that you discover
the prodigies of talent displayed in the drawing
and finishing of this picture. An angel, suspended
in front of the lower portion of the group, more especially
attracts the attention. One leg is extended
towards the spectator, the foreshortening of which
is a marvel of execution.</p>

<p>Over the San Antonio, as it does not reach to
the ceiling, there is a smaller picture, representing
the Baptism of Christ, also by Murillo. In a chapel
at the south-west angle of the church, there are
several fine paintings by Luis de Vargas, one of
the founders of the school of Seville.</p>

<p>In the choir, the collection of books for the
chanting services is worth seeing. Of these immense
folios, enclosed in massive covers, bound
with a profusion of wrought metal mostly silver&mdash;may
be counted upwards of a hundred. They are
filled with paintings, infinite in minuteness and
beauty. For the performances of the daily services
and all duties, ordinary and extraordinary, within
this edifice, more than eight hundred persons are<a name="page_366" id="page_366"></a>
employed. Five hundred masses are recited each
day at the different altars: all of which taking place
during the early part of the day, an idea may be
formed of the business which goes on. Of the six
or seven organs, I have heard three playing at the
same time in different parts of the church; but so
widely separated, as by no means to interfere
with each other's harmony. One of them was one
of the two great organs which face each other
over the choir. These two play a duet once a year,
on the day of the Corpus. The effect they produce
is not so powerful as that produced at Toledo,
but far more beautiful. At Toledo the two
which correspond to these, are assisted on that occasion
by a third, as powerful as both the others
united, placed over the portal of the south transept,
at an elevation of about seventy feet from the
ground.</p>

<p>Among the ceremonies of the cathedral of Seville
is one sufficiently unique to be deserving of notice.
<i>El baile de los seis</i> (dance of the six), is performed
by eight youths&mdash;probably by six originally&mdash;every
evening during the feast of the Conception.
It takes place in front of the high-altar, on which
her statue is placed on that occasion. The service
is one of especial solemnity; and, as such,
accompanied, unfortunately as on all such occasions,<a name="page_367" id="page_367"></a>
by an orchestra of violins, to the exclusion
of the organs. The singing commences at four
o'clock in the afternoon, in the choir, and continues
until half-past six, when all move in procession
through the great railing, across the transept,
and ascend the flight of steps which lead
to the Capilla Mayor. Here they take their seats
according to rank, on benches placed in rows from
east to west, fronting a space which is left open
down the centre, in front of the altar. The orchestra
occupies a corner near the railing; and on
the two front benches are seated&mdash;four facing four&mdash;the
eight youths, dressed in the ancient Spanish
costume, all sky blue silk and white muslin, and
holding each his hat, also light blue, with a flowing
white feather.</p>

<p>The chorus now recommences, but speedily drops;
when the orchestra sounds a beautiful air in the
waltz measure. This is played once by the instruments
alone, and joined the second time by the
voices of the eight boys, or youths of the age of sixteen
to eighteen; who, after having accompanied a
short time, start to their legs, and continue in the
same strain. At the next reprise they all, as if by
word of command, place their hats on their heads,
and one or two minutes after, the chant still continuing,
advance, and meet in the centre, then return<a name="page_368" id="page_368"></a>
each to his place; advance a second time, and turn
round each other, using the waltz step.</p>

<p>After singing and dancing for about a quarter of
an hour, the voices are exchanged for the sounds of
castagnettes, which they have held all this time in
their hands, and the measure becomes more animated;
and thus they terminate the performance. The
same ceremony is repeated each night of the seven;
only varying the air of the waltz, of which they
have two.</p>

<p>This ceremony, now belonging exclusively to the
cathedral of Seville, was originally performed in
some other cathedrals; but has been gradually laid
aside in all the others, having been found to occasion
irreverent behaviour among a portion of the
spectators. It was originally introduced among
the observances in honour of the anniversary of the
Conception, as a natural manifestation of joy; and
such a genuine Spanish bolero would have been:
but the slow time of the music, and the measured
movements, adopted for the purpose of suiting the
performance to the solemnity of the place, have
changed the nature of the dance, and deprived it
of everything approaching to cheerfulness.<a name="page_369" id="page_369"></a></p>

<h5>SPANISH BEGGARS. HAIRDRESSING. THE GIRALDA. CASA DE
PILATOS. MONASTERIES. ITALICA.</h5>

<p class="r">Seville.<br />
</p>

<p>Mendicity is one of the Curiosities&mdash;and not the
least picturesque one&mdash;of this antique country.
There should be a Mendicity Society for its preservation,
together with other legacies of the middle
ages. An entertaining book might be filled with
its annals and anecdotes.</p>

<p>Nowhere, I should think, can beggary be a more
lucrative calling. The convents having been the
inexhaustible providence of these tribes, on their
suppression the well-born and bred Spaniards consider
the charge to have devolved upon them,
in the absence of all possible legislation on the
subject: and few, especially of the fair sex, turn a
deaf ear to the mute eloquence of the open hand.
Even a stranger, if possessed of an ear, resists with
difficulty the graceful appeal of the well trained<a name="page_370" id="page_370"></a>
proficient: <i>Noble caballero, un ochavito por Dios.</i>&mdash;A
blind girl made no request; but exclaimed&mdash;"Oh
that the Virgin of Carmen may preserve your
sight!"</p>

<p>The mendicants are classified, and assume every
form of external humanity. Being in the coach-office
near the Plaza del Duque, a tall well-dressed
man, dangling a dark kid glove, entered, and,
walking up to the book-keeper, after having carefully
closed the door, made some communication to him
in a low voice. The other replied in a similar tone,
and they parted with mutual bows. I was puzzled
on the man's turning to me and observing that the
beggars were very annoying in Seville; but still
certain my conjecture could not but be erroneous, I
said "you don't mean to say that your acquaintance"&mdash;"Oh,
no acquaintance; I never saw him before:
he only came to beg."</p>

<p>This species of <i>cavallero</i> pauper should by no
means be encouraged; he is not of the picturesque
sort. Nowhere do the wretches look their character
better than at Seville; as all admirers of Murillo
can testify, without consulting any other nature
than his canvass. But these consider they confer
a sort of obligation on the individual they condescend
to apply to. Nothing can exceed their
astonishment and indignation when refused. Their<a name="page_371" id="page_371"></a>
great highway is the superb polished mosaic marble
of the Cathedral; where they divide the authority
with the embroidered dignitaries of the choir. It
is useless to hope for an instant's leisure for the
contemplation of this unique temple, until you
have disposed of its entire population of ragged
despots.</p>

<p>A sort of chivalrous etiquette is observed, in
virtue of which a female chorus is the first to form
your escort from pillar to pillar. These dismissed,
you are delivered over to the barefooted Murillos.
There are two modes of escape. The rich man
should go in with his two hands filled with coin,
and distribute to all, even to many who will return
for a second contribution before he has done. But
if economical, you may attain the same end, and
more permanently, by sacrificing four or five days
to walking up and down the nave, without looking
at anything, but simply undergoing the persecution
of the mob. After the fourth visit you will be left
in peace.</p>

<p>These counsels I am competent to give you from
dreadful experience; more dreadful from my having
pursued a middle course. To one barefooted and
rotten-scalped embryo brigand I only gave a two-<i>quarto</i>
piece (halfpenny) about equal in real consequence
to twopence in England. If you have<a name="page_372" id="page_372"></a>
ever seen, in the era of mail coaches, the look of
quiet surprise on the countenance of the well-fed
charioteer, who, having, after the sixth or seventh
stage, opened the door, and muttered from behind
his <i>cache-nez</i> the usual "coachman, gen'lemen"
received a long-searched-for deprecatory sixpence
from some careful knight with a false shirt-collar&mdash;you
have noticed the self-same look, which was
leisurely transferred by the urchin from the piece of
copper in the open palm to my face, and back to
the piece of copper.</p>

<p>Instead, however, of restoring it to me, his indignation
seemed to inspire him with a sudden resolution.
He rushed to a kneeling Señorita a few
paces distant, and interrupting her devotions by a
pull at the side of her mantilla, he showed the
coin in the open hand, while with the other he
pointed to the culprit. If he meditated revenge,
he should have made another choice, instead of
deranging a garment, from the folds of which a
real Andalucian mouth and pair of eyes, turning
full on me, aimed a smile which, I need not inform
you, was not dear at two <i>quartos</i>.</p>

<p>Could such a smile have been natural, and the
expression of mere curiosity, or was it intended for
a death-wound, dealt for another's vengeance? and
did the velvet language of those eyes signify a<a name="page_373" id="page_373"></a>
horrible "Pallas te hoc vulnere," in favour of the
ragamuffin I had offended? At all events, the incident
lost him a more munificent remuneration,
by driving me from the spot, and expelling from
my head, a project previously formed, of inviting
him to my <i>fonda</i> to be sketched.</p>

<p>With regard to the oft and still recurring subject
of Spanish beauty, you are hereby warned
against giving ear to what may be said by tourists,
who, by way of taking a new view of an old subject,
simply give the lie to their predecessors. It
is true, that in the central provinces, the genuine characteristic
Moro-Iberian beauty is rare, and that there
is little of any other sort to replace it; but this is
not the case with Andalucia, where you may arrive
fresh from the perusal of the warm effusions of the
most smitten of poets, and find the Houris of real
flesh and blood, by no means overrated.</p>

<p>One of their peculiar perfections extends to all
parts of the Peninsula. This is the hair; everywhere
your eye lights upon some passing specimen
of these unrivalled masses of braided jet; at which
not unfrequently natives of the same sex turn
with an exclamation&mdash;Que pelo tan hermoso!</p>

<p>I surprised the other day a village matron, whose
toilette, it being a holiday afternoon, was in progress
in no more secluded a <i>tocador</i> than the middle of<a name="page_374" id="page_374"></a>
the road. The rustic lady's-maid (whether the
practice be more or less fashionable I know not)
had placed on a stool, within reach of her right
hand as she stood behind her seated mistress, a jug of
fresh water. This did she lift, just as I approached,
up to her mouth, into which she received
as large a portion of its contents as could be
there accommodated; while with her left hand
she grasped the extremity of a mass of silken hair,
black as the raven's wing, and an ell in length.
Both hands now, stroking down the mass, spread
it out so as to present a horizontal surface of as
large an extent as possible, when, suddenly, from
the inflated cheeks of the abigail, re-issued with a
loud sound the now tepid liquid, and bathed the
entire surface, which it seemed to render, if possible,
still more glossy than before. The rest of the duty
of the hands appeared to consist in repeatedly
separating and replacing the handfuls, until the
same proceeding was reacted.</p>

<p>The entrance to the Giralda is outside the
cathedral. Before we make the ascent, we will walk
to the extremity of the Moorish enclosure of the
orange-court, along the raised pavement which
surrounds the whole. At the angle there is an
antique shaft of granite, higher than the rest of
those placed at equal distances along the edge of<a name="page_375" id="page_375"></a>
the pavement. From that point the proportions
of the tower are seen to advantage, while you are at
the same time sufficiently near to observe the details
of the carving, and of the windows, with their
delicately formed columns of rare marbles; and
to lose in a great measure the effect of the subsequent
additions, which surmount and disfigure the
work of Geber.</p>

<p>The Arabian part of the building is a square
of about forty-five feet, and measures in elevation
four times its width. The ornaments are not
exactly alike on all the four sides. On the north
side (our present view) the tracery commences at a
height of eighty feet, up to which point the wall
of brick is perfectly plain and smooth, with only
the interruption of two windows, placed one above
the other in the centre. The ornament, from its
commencement to the summit, is divided into two
lofty stories, surmounted by a third, of half the
height of one of the others. The two first are
divided vertically into three parts by narrow
stripes of the plain wall. The centre portions
contain two windows in each story, one over the
other, making, with the two in the lower portion,
six altogether, which are at equal distances from
each other. The form of these windows is varied,
and in all uncommonly elegant; some are double,<a name="page_376" id="page_376"></a>
with a marble column supporting their two arches,
and all are ornamented round the arches with beautiful
tracery, and furnished with marble balconies.
At one of the balconies, the Muezzin, in Mahometan
times was accustomed to present himself at each of
the hours appointed for prayer, and to pronounce
the sentences ordained by that religion for calling
the people. The half-story at the summit is ornamented
with a row of arches, supported by pilasters.</p>

<p>On the top of the tower were seen originally, four
gilded balls of different sizes, one over the other,
diminishing upwards; the iron bar on which they
were fixed, was struck by lightning, and gave way,
leaving the balls to roll over; since which period
they were never restored to their place.</p>

<p>The additional buildings were not erected until
the seventeenth century. They are not in themselves
inelegant, with the exception of the portion
immediately rising from the old tower, and containing
the bells. This portion is of the same
width as the tower, and appears to weigh it down
with its heavy effect; on the summit of the whole,
at about three hundred feet from the ground, is a
colossal statue of bronze, representing Faith, holding
in one hand a shield, and in the other an olive-branch.
By means of the shield, the statue obeys
the movements of the wind, and thus gives the
name of Giralda (weather-cock) to the tower.<a name="page_377" id="page_377"></a></p>

<p>An interior tower, rather more than twenty feet
square, runs up the whole height of the Moorish
portion of the building; between which and the external
walls an easy ascent is contrived on an inclined
plane. The necessity of introducing light
throughout the ascent accounts for the different
elevation of the windows and ornaments of the different
sides; but the architect has so managed this
difficulty, that no bad effect is produced in the external
view. At the lower part of the tower the
ascent is sufficiently wide to admit of the passage of
two men on horseback abreast; but it becomes narrower
as it approaches the summit. Queen Christina
is said to have been drawn up in a small carriage.
The walls, both of the inner and outer tower, increase
in thickness as they rise, and as the ascending
plane decreases in width: a plan which appears opposed
to the principle usually adopted by modern
architects.</p>

<p>It is known that Geber was the architect of the
Giralda, but no certainty exists respecting its date.
The Spanish antiquarian Don Rodrigo Caro supposes
it to have been erected during the reign of Benabet
Almucamus, King of Seville, shortly before the appearance
in Spain of the Almoravides; but this is no
more than a conjecture, founded on the supposed
wealth of that King, who possessed larger states<a name="page_378" id="page_378"></a>
than his successors, and who paid no tribute to the
sovereigns of Castile.</p>

<p>Immediately over the highest story of the Moorish
tower is the belfry. The bells are suspended on the
centre of revolving beams, which traverse the open
arches of the four faces of the tower. They are
consequently in full view, as they throw their somersets
and send forth their lively clatter on a <i>dia de
fiesta</i>.</p>

<p>Their effect is very original, and as unlike as possible
to the monotonous and melancholy cadence
of an English peal. None of them are deep-toned
nor solemn, but all high and sharp: so that being
let loose in merry disorder, and without tune, they
somehow appear to harmonize with the brilliant skies,
just as the descending ding-dong in England suits
the gloom of the northern heavens. Leave Seville,
and never shall their tones steal on your memory
without your being transported into a blaze of bright
sunshine.</p>

<p>In Spain the houses of the grandees are not
called palaces, as those of the same rank in Italy are
usually termed. There is not even an intermediate
term, such as mansion,&mdash;still less the hall&mdash;abbey, or
castle. They have the last, but only applied in cases
in which it is correctly and legitimately applicable.
The Arab expression <i>alcazar</i>, composed of the article<a name="page_379" id="page_379"></a>
<i>al</i> and <i>cazar</i>, is so like the Spanish <i>la casa</i> (the house),
that, not having at hand a professor of Arabic to
consult, I will risk the assertion that it bore the
same meaning; notwithstanding the opinion of
several French writers who translate it <i>château</i>.
Chenier, author of the history of Morocco, derives
it from the word Caissar, which he considers synonymous
with Cæsar: but this derivation appears to
admit of much doubt, as the word would signify
the Emperor, instead of his residence. Supposing
it to signify the house, it must no doubt have meant
the principal, or royal house. At present the two
words are admitted into the Spanish language as one,
which is applied indiscriminately to royal town-residences,
whether castles or not, as well as the term
<i>palacio</i>. But a private residence of whatever extent
is modestly termed a house.</p>

<p>In this instance, as in many others, the proud contempt
of high-sounding phraseology is common to
Spain and England, where some of the most palace-like
habitations are called Wentworth House, Hatfield
House, Burleigh House: the very porters' lodges
being sometimes such edifices as would claim the
title of <i>château</i> in some other countries. But this
same haughty modesty is rather individual than collective,
and does not prevail as applied to towns and
cities. In public acts and addresses, and even in the<a name="page_380" id="page_380"></a>
most homely precautionary warnings placarded at
the corners of streets or promenades, the form used
is,&mdash;"The constitutional Alcalde of this heroic and
very invincible town of Madrid, or Seville, forbids, or
orders, &amp;c.;" and still more splendid epithets are
found for the nation in general.</p>

<p>I don't know whether it has occurred to you that
this progressive dereliction of consistency is universal
in human nature, although it assumes a variety of
forms. In the present instance modesty commences
at home, as they say charity should.</p>

<p>By the way, if charity should commence at home,
together with the other affections of the heart, such
as patriotism, then did the first Brutus make a mistake.
If, on the contrary, his merit was great in
sacrificing his son to his nation, it follows, that, in
causing his entire nation to be butchered the first
time they were guilty of any encroachment on the
rights of the rest of the world, his glory would have
increased in the ratio of one to some millions.</p>

<p>He either acted on a principle of justice, or preferred
the applause of his compatriots to the affection
of his son. If, therefore, an opportunity was ever
afforded him of doing the world the above-mentioned
act of justice at the expense of his countrymen,
and he abstained from it,&mdash;it being impossible to
suppose a Roman republican capable of a dereliction<a name="page_381" id="page_381"></a>
of principle&mdash;it is clear that he preferred the applause
of his nation to that of the rest of the world; and all
becomes a question of taste. But what, you exclaim,
has the first or any other Brutus to do with Pilate's
house, the description of which is preceded by this
long introduction? And was not his murder of his
son benevolence itself, compared to the infliction of
these digressions on your patience?</p>

<p>The Casa de Palatos is a palace belonging to the
Duke of Medina C&#339;li. One of his ancestors is said
to have built it in exact imitation of Pontius Pilate's
palace in Jerusalem, and to have obtained possession
of a large quantity of the ornaments and portable
furniture belonging to the ancient building, which,
on the completion of his edifice at Seville, he established,
each object in the place corresponding to that
which it originally occupied.</p>

<p>A lofty wall, filling the side of the small square,
called the Plaza de Pilatos, and surmounted by a
balustrade, forms the outer enclosure of the palace.
You enter through a large plain arched doorway,
and pass through a court, containing the porter's
house, and other out-buildings devoid of ornament.
A small door on the left leads from this enclosure
to the principal court. Here you might imagine
yourself still in the Alcazar. The ornament is in
the same style; only the arcades are inferior in lightness<a name="page_382" id="page_382"></a>
and beauty. It contains, however, a fountain
very superior to that of the principal court of the
Alcazar.</p>

<p>At the four angles are colossal statues of white
marble, representing deities of the Grecian mythology.
They are antique, and of Roman origin.
Under the arcades a series of busts of the Roman
emperors, are placed round the walls; the greater
part of them are also antique. On one side of this
court is the chapel, very small, and entirely covered
with Arabesque ornament. At one side is placed
erect against the wall a black cross, said to be a facsimile
imitation of that actually carried by our Saviour,
which occupied a similar situation in the palace
at Jerusalem. Its length is about seven feet,
and the thickness of the wood about four inches
by two. Opposite to the cross is a Madonna by Raffaelle.
As no light enters the chapel, excepting
through a small door, and that placed under the arcades,
and the picture is hung at a considerable
height, it can only be examined by the aid of a ladder,
which is kept near it, and then only very imperfectly.
At the time the chapel was habitually used,
it probably contained candles always burning.</p>

<p>The great staircase is very ornamental and leads
to several handsome suites of rooms. There is a
colonnade on one side of the garden, under which<a name="page_383" id="page_383"></a>
lies a valuable collection of antique busts, columns,
capitals, and fragments of all sorts, "in most admired
disorder." The proprietor never visits this residence,
and every part of it is in a very neglected state.</p>

<p>Seville lays claim to no less a founder than Hercules.
A magnificent temple dedicated to him is
said to have existed on the spot at present occupied
by the parish church of San Nicholas. Near
it a statue of the demigod has been discovered, together
with six columns, four of which are sunk
so deeply in the earth that they cannot be brought
to light. The other two are placed on lofty pedestals,
and adorn the largest of the promenades of
Seville, that called the Alameda. One of them is
surmounted by the statue mentioned above, and the
other by one of Julius Cæsar. Venus is also stated
to have shared with Hercules the devotions of the
Sevillanos. The existence of her worship in ancient
times is placed beyond a doubt by the well authenticated
martyrdom of Saints Justa and Rufina, condemned
for refusing to do honour to the rites of
that goddess, and to figure in her processions.</p>

<p>These two martyrs to the Christian faith have
pursued, on various subsequent occasions, a conduct
calculated to afford a degree of advantage to an adversary,
should he presume to accuse them of renegade
propensities. They have manifested themselves<a name="page_384" id="page_384"></a>
determined protectors of the Arab tower, on
every occasion of its being threatened with danger.
Numerous instances are on record; the most remarkable
of which, is one that has given rise to much
controversy, and employed in more recent times the
researches of learned men. The tradition states,
that, during an earthquake, which took place in the
year 1504, and of which a vivid description may be
found at the end of a book, called the Regla Vieja,
which exists in the archives of the cathedral&mdash;the
two virgins were seen to support the tower and
prevent it from falling, surrounding it with their
arms, one on each side. It is also related that, on the
occasion of a previous earthquake, that of the year
1396, voices were heard in the air, articulated by
demons, crying, "Throw it down, throw it down;"
and that others replied, "No, we cannot, for those
villanous saints, Justa and Rufina, are guarding it."
For these reasons it is usual, in paintings representing
the Giralda, to place the figures of the two
virgin Saints supporting it, one on either side; and
a small model thus supported by images of the two
martyrs, executed in wood, is carried in the principal
religious processions. In all these representations,
the figures stand rather taller than the tower.</p>

<p>The hospital of La Caridad is one of the principal
attractions to strangers at Seville; for in its chapel<a name="page_385" id="page_385"></a>
is contained the picture, which passes for the master-piece
of Murillo. The chapel is narrow and
lofty, and the picture placed as near as possible to
the ceiling. A sight of it can only be obtained at
an angle of about twenty degrees. But the aching
of the neck is unheeded during the examination of
this superb picture. It is called Las Aguas, the
Waters. Moses has just struck the rock, and stands
in a simple and dignified attitude. In the complete
contentment of his countenance there may be traced
a mingled expression of pity and gratitude, as he
looks on the scene which follows his action. The
artist has given proof of consummate talent in the
choice and treatment of his subject; which afforded
him a variety of grouping, of expression, and of attitude,
of which few were capable of taking better advantage.</p>

<p>This picture is a specimen of his natural style, and
its success is considered, and I think justly, superior
to that of any other of his works. The imitation of
material nature is here carried to as great perfection
as in many of his paintings; while at the same time
nothing can surpass the poetry of the composition,
nor the exquisitely harmonious grouping of the men
and animals. In this last quality, Murillo is certainly
unequalled. He seems also in this instance,
to have reached the utmost limits of art in the expression<a name="page_386" id="page_386"></a>
of the countenances, throughout the different
groups, whether employed in offering silent
thanksgivings, or entirely absorbed in the eager effort
to obtain for their parched lips a draught of the
bright liquid. In the feeling displayed in these
instances, and so well represented, there is, it is true,
nothing elevated, but still it is feeling; and its materiality
is amply made amends for, by the chief
personage of the scene, in whose countenance nothing
but the sublime can be traced.</p>

<p>Had Murillo not painted this picture and the
Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, Spanish art must have
contented itself with the second rank, and Raphael
would have continued without a rival. These pictures
occasion regret that such genius should have
employed itself during a long period, on works
of a different sort. The San Antonio and a few
others, were no doubt productions worthy of the painter
of the Aguas, and a hundred or two others are
magnificent paintings; but the time employed on
some of these, and on a still greater number of less
prominent merit, would have been more profitably
devoted to the production of two or three which
might have ranked with these giant creations of
his talent.</p>

<p>In viewing either of these compositions, the other
speedily becomes present to the imagination, and<a name="page_387" id="page_387"></a>
forces you to draw a comparison between them.
They have a sort of affinity in their subject as well
as in their style. The sufferers of the St. Elizabeth,
occupied with their torments and their gratitude,
answer to those of the Aguas, engrossed also
with almost parallel feelings. The Moses, tranquil
and erect in the midst of the action which surrounds
him, is the exact pendant of the majestic figure and
compassionate countenance of the youthful princess,
exercising her saintly charities. These pictures
ought to be companions in the same gallery, were
it possible for two such works to find their way
into one and the same apartment. But that would
be a consummation as hopeless as finding St. Peter's
and the Duomo of Milan in the same town; Naples
and Seville in one province, a London and a Paris
in one country, an Ariosto and a Byron in the same
language. It has more than once occurred to me,
since I have seen these two pictures, that were
Raphael's Spasimo and Transfiguration placed on
one side of a room, and these two on the other,
and the choice offered me which pair I would possess,
I should never be able to come to a decision.</p>

<p>Another large picture by Murillo, the multiplying
of the Loaves in the Desert, is suspended opposite
the Aguas, and at the same elevation. On attempting
to examine it, you are forcibly reminded by certain<a name="page_388" id="page_388"></a>
acute sensations in the region of the neck, of
the unnatural position it has so long maintained,
and you leave this picture, together with two others,
placed near the entrance of the chapel, for a subsequent
visit.</p>

<p>In the church of the Faubourg Triana, on the
right hand after passing the bridge, are some excellent
pictures, particularly a Conception by Murillo.
The multitude of paintings left by this artist is incredible,
when to all those scattered through Spain,
France, and England, are added those preserved in
this his native town. Almost all the good houses in
Seville contain collections of pictures; and all the collections
have their Murillos. There are no fewer than
sixteen in the gallery of the Canon, Don Manuel Cepero;
but this is the largest of the private collections,
and the best, as it ought to be, since it is contained in
Murillo's house. It is the residence occupied by him
during the latter part of his life, and in which he
died. Its dimensions and distribution are handsome.
At the back of it there is a garden of limited extent,
but in which not an inch of space is thrown away.
Where there remains no room for choice flowers
and orange trees, the walls are painted to prolong
the illusion. The Canon possesses also several good
paintings by Italian masters. I counted likewise
four Rembrandts, and two of Rubens. Among the<a name="page_389" id="page_389"></a>
other private collections, that of the Alcalde Don
Pedro Garcia is one of the richest; it contains a
Santa Barbara of Cano, an exquisite picture. A Saint
Joseph by Murillo, in the collection of the French
Consul (a native of Seville) is admirable.</p>

<p>In most of the churches there is sufficient of this
sort of attraction to make them worth a visit.
In the convents nothing is left; in fact they no
longer exist as convents. There may be one or
two remaining in Seville, but I did not hear of
them. The monastery of Jeronimites, and the
Chartreuse&mdash;both situated in the environs&mdash;were
the most considerable religious establishments of
Seville. They are converted, one into a school, and
the other into a porcelain manufactory. This last,
the Chartreuse, contains in its church and refectory,
plentiful traces of its former magnificence. An
Englishman has purchased the monastery with
three or four acres of ground, containing the immediate
dependencies; and he is occupied with
the labours which necessarily precede its appearance
in its new character, replacing the butteries,
kitchens, storehouses, and cells, by rows of pudding-shaped
baking-houses.</p>

<p>He has, however, spared the chapel, which is to
continue in its former state. All the stalls, the
altar, and other immoveable furniture, remain as<a name="page_390" id="page_390"></a>
he found them. The pictures and statues had of
course been previously removed. The woodwork
is inimitable&mdash;the best I have seen in Spain; it would
be impossible in painting to represent with more
delicacy, the very texture of the drapery, the very
veins of the hands, and hair of the beards&mdash;of figures
of a quarter the natural dimensions. You are
filled with astonishment, that the infinite patience
necessary for this mechanical labour should have
accompanied the genius which conceived and executed
the incomparable figures and heads. The
refectory, of which the ceiling is the principal
ornament, is to be the great show-room for the
display of the china. The fortunate manufacturer
inhabits, with his family, the prior's residence&mdash;one
of the most elegant habitations in the world: surrounding
a court, which contains of course its
white marble fountain and colonnades: and he is
in treaty for the purchase of the orange-grove, the
park of the monastery. This pleasure-ground is
ornamented here and there with Kiosks, from which
are obtained views of Seville, and the intervening
Guadalquivir.</p>

<p>On the confiscation of this monastery, several
magnificent pictures disappeared, a few of which
have since been placed in the cathedral. Two
alabaster monuments, belonging to the family of<a name="page_391" id="page_391"></a>
Medina Cæli, were also removed; they are placed
in a church at present under repair. They are
erect, and fit into the wall; measuring about forty
feet in height. Their upper portion is adorned with
several well-executed small statues.</p>

<p>The other convent&mdash;that dedicated to S. Geronimo,
is situated on the opposite side of the river, about
a mile higher up. It is not so beautiful as the
Cartuja, but on a grander scale. The principal court
is magnificent; it is surrounded with upper and
lower arcades, respectively of the Ionic and Doric
orders: the apartments and church are of corresponding
extent; but have either been deprived of
their ornaments, or were originally but sparingly
decorated. A ci-devant governor of Seville&mdash;a
general officer, very distinguished as a linguist, has
turned schoolmaster, and taken up his abode here.
The day of my visit happened to be the general's
birthday, and a scene of much festivity presented
itself. The schoolmaster's successor in his former
post at Seville, had arrived, attended by the band
of a cavalry regiment; and the great court having
been converted into a ball-room, the marble arcades
were made to ring with the thrilling cadences of
the hautbois and clarionette&mdash;by way of a fitting
afterpiece to the tragic chants of former days.</p>

<p>The relatives and friends of the students were<a name="page_392" id="page_392"></a>
present, so that the youthful dancers were well-provided
with partners. The performances were
French quadrilles, English hornpipes, German
waltzes, Russian mazurkas, and Spanish fandangos.
I had arrived too late for the first part of the entertainment,
which consisted of a bull-fight, for
which a temporary arena had been enclosed. The
bulls were what are called <i>novillos</i>&mdash;that is, scarcely
more than calves; as the full-grown animals would
have been more than a match for their juvenile
antagonists.</p>

<p>The ruins of the Roman city of Italica, to which
I have already alluded, are situated four miles from
Seville in ascending the river&mdash;and on the opposite
bank. The whole town is underground, with the
exception of a few houses in the part in which
excavations have been made, and of the amphitheatre
which occupies an eminence. No notice was taken
in modern times of the existence of this buried town,
until towards the end of the last century, when the remains
of the amphitheatre, the only portion of the ruins
which were visible, drew the attention of travellers:
and the authorities of Seville received orders to commence
excavating. The search yielded a large quantity
of valuable remains; a temple was discovered,
in the neighbourhood of which were found several
statues and capitals of columns. A choice was made<a name="page_393" id="page_393"></a>
of the objects in the best state of preservation,
which were forwarded to Madrid in order to form
a museum. Large quantities of coins were also
sent, and collections of household utensils, and
ornaments. The Arabs, who did not consider these
Roman relics worthy objects of antiquarian research,
nevertheless had either discovered and laid
open a large portion of the town, or were themselves
its destroyers. From it they extracted the
large quantities of marble columns and slabs with
which Seville is filled. The mutilated statues,
together with several funereal monuments, found in
later times, and not considered deserving of the
journey to Madrid, have been deposited in a large
room in the Alcazar of Seville, where they are now
exhibited.</p>

<p>No record exists of the foundation of Italica.
Its annals are traced to the time of Scipio Africanus,
who, on the completion of his conquest of Spain,
and the final expulsion of the Carthaginians, finding
himself embarrassed by the number of wounded
and sick among his troops, established them in
this town under the protection of a garrison. He
gave to the town its name of Italica,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> its previous<a name="page_394" id="page_394"></a>
name being Sancius: the real situation of Italica
has been the subject of much controversy. Like
the Grecian cities, which claimed each to be the
birthplace of Homer, several of the towns in the
neighbourhood of Seville are candidates for the honour
of being representatives of the ancient Italica;
but ample proof exists of the identity of these
ruins with that city.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The Historia general, written
by Alonso el Sabio, book 1., chap, <span class="smcap">XV.</span>, speaks of
Italica as a place of much importance in ancient
times, in allusion to the invasion of a people called
the Almunizes. He adds, in the antiquated Spanish
of his time, "Las nuevas fueron por todas las
tierras de como aquellas gentes avian ganado a
España, e todos los de las islas quel oyeron crecieron
les corazones por fazer otro tal, e ayuntaron muy
grandes navios, e vinieronse para España, e entraron<a name="page_395" id="page_395"></a>
por cuatro partes. Los que entraron por Cadiz
vinieron Guadalquibir arriba, e llegaron a Italica
e los de la villa salieron e lidiaron con ellos, e los
de fuera entraron con ellos de vuelta por medio
de la villa, e mataron los a todos, e ganaron la
villa." It is not clear what invasion is here alluded
to.</p>

<p>The town of Italica was one of the six or seven
in these provinces which possessed the title of
<i>municipia</i>; a superior one to that of <i>colonia</i>, from
its involving the privilege of retaining its ancient
laws and customs, while on the colonies those of
Rome were imposed. It was among the cities
which sheltered some of the earliest converts to
Christianity. Its first bishop was the martyr Saint
Geruncio, put to death in prison. The prison,
being considered sanctified, from its containing the
saint's remains, became subsequently the resort of
pious votaries from all parts of the province. In
the Mozarabic ritual there is a hymn for the day
of this saint, one of the stanzas of which fixes
the epoque of his life and martyrdom, at that of
the apostles.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><a name="page_396" id="page_396"></a></p>

<p>The centurion Cornelius, mentioned in the Acts
of the Apostles, as converted by the preaching of
St. Peter, was, it is said, a native of this city, and
commanded a cohort raised in his native place.</p>

<p>The date of the destruction of Italica, is as uncertain
as that of its origin. The fact of its existence
during almost the entire period of the Gothic
dominion, is established, by the presence of its
bishops being recorded at the different councils.
It is conjectured that its destruction was the work
of the Arabs, who were no sooner in possession of
Seville, than they considered it imprudent to allow
so large a town to be in the hands of enemies in
their immediate neighbourhood. This supposition
of Spanish antiquaries seems hazarded without sufficient
reflection; since, in the first place, had the
occupants of Italica occasioned the Arabs any uneasiness,
nothing was easier than to occupy the
place themselves; and secondly, the ruins bear
strong symptoms of having been reduced to their
present state by some convulsion of nature, rather
than by human agency: not to mention the coins
discovered in large quantities, which would not
have been neglected by human destroyers. It is
not likely that the destruction of so considerable
a place by the conquerors of the province, at the
time they were too few to defend it, would have<a name="page_397" id="page_397"></a>
been overlooked by their historians&mdash;who make no
allusion to the event.</p>

<p>The present appearance is that of a green undulating
hill, which no one would imagine to be
composed of the remains of streets, palaces, temples,
and market-places. The upper portion only of the
amphitheatre remains above-ground. Its form is
slightly oval, nearly approaching to a circle. The
greatest diameter is three hundred and twenty-five
feet. It has twenty rows of seats, half of which
are buried; each seat is two feet and a half in
depth, and two in height. Part of the Podium
remains; and enough of the entrance, to distinguish
that it consisted of three large arches. It
was constructed with Roman solidity. Nothing less
than an earthquake could have toppled over the
masses of masonry, which appear in their confusion
like solid rocks. A very small portion of the ruins
has been explored: and part of that, for want of
being sufficiently cleared out, is again buried in
earth, and the work is discontinued. The objects
now above-ground, consist of five or six tessalated
floors, two of which have been considered of sufficient
value to be walled in, and locked up, but without
being roofed.</p>

<p>These ruins are well worth a visit, although the
road to them from Seville, bears terrible symptoms<a name="page_398" id="page_398"></a>
of having been constructed before Macadam's day;
perhaps even before that of the Scipios.</p>

<p>At the distance of a few hundred yards from
the nearest portion of the ruined town is situated
the village of Santi-ponce, in which is the convent of
S. Isidoro, of the order of St. Jerome. The church
contains the tombs of Don Alonzo Perez de Guzman,
surnamed the Good, and of his wife Doña Maria
Alonzo Coronel, founders of the ducal house of
Medina Sidonia. This family obtained from Ferdinand
the Fourth, a grant of Santi-ponce and old
Seville (Italica), with the district, and temporal and
spiritual jurisdiction. Don Sancho had already rewarded
the services and tried fidelity of Perez de
Guzman by presenting him with the town of Medina
Sidonia. An anecdote is told of him worthy
of a Roman republican. Being governor of Tarifa
under Sancho the Fourth, he had to defend
the town against the Infant, Don Juan, who had
revolted against his brother. This prince, learning
that a child of Guzman was in his power, being at
nurse in the environs of the town, sent for it; and,
presenting himself before the walls, declared to the
governor that he would kill the child, if the town
were not immediately surrendered. Guzman replied
by drawing his sword, and throwing it down to the
prince, who had the barbarity to order the infant
to be murdered before his father's eyes.<a name="page_399" id="page_399"></a></p>

<h5>PRIVATE HOUSES, AND LOCAL CUSTOMS IN SEVILLE.</h5>

<p class="r">Seville.<br />
</p>

<p>The greater number of private houses are situated
in an interminable labyrinth of winding streets,
between the Calle de la Sierpe, and Plaza de San
Francisco and the city wall, which connects the
Aqueduct of Carmona with the Alcazar. It is the
South-eastern half of the city. To the west of the
Calle de la Sierpe there are also a few streets
containing private residences, but they are not in
so large a proportion. Some of the most elegant
are, however, on this side; which being less Moorish
and more modern, is less chary of its attractions,
and allows a part of its decoration to enliven the
external façades; while its spacious doorways frequently
open to the view of the passer-by a gay
perspective of gardens and courts.</p>

<p>The sunny balcony, crowded with a crimson forest
of cactuses, is not more attractive to the sight,<a name="page_400" id="page_400"></a>
than the more mysterious vista beneath it, of retreating
colonnades, mingled with orange and pomegranate
trees, through which the murmur of the
fountain is scarcely audible. Few cities present
more charms to the wanderer than one in which the
houses offer a combination so luxurious as is met
with in the greater number of those of Seville.
The cool summer rooms opening into the court, in
which the drawing-room furniture is arranged on all
sides of a fountain, plentifully supplied from the
aqueduct of Carmona: and, on the upper floor, the
winter apartments, chosen from their being better
lighted, for the deposit of a collection of pictures
and these almost always excellent,&mdash;and opening to
the gallery; to which, during this season, the furniture
having been removed from below, is placed, together
with the work frames and portable musical instruments,
on the side exposed to the sun. One sees
these houses and their amiable and happy-looking
inhabitants, and imagines there is no life to be compared
to it. Yet the experiment may be made, and
fail to answer the expectations of the stranger, who,
confident in his discovery of the road to happiness,
may have pitched his tent in the midst of these bewitching
regions.</p>

<p>Can it be fatality&mdash;or is it essential in human
nature, to find ever the least felicity there, where it<a name="page_401" id="page_401"></a>
looks for the greatest? The experiment, I say, was
made. An Englishman, possessing every advantage
of taste, talent, and wealth, took up his residence
here, resolved to devote the remainder of his days to
the peaceable enjoyments of a literary and social
life. Thanks to his literary propensities, we are
enabled to judge of the result of the trial. In a
book published by the person to whom I allude, we
find that no one could be less satisfied with his lot.
Seville and the Sevillanos meet with no mercy at his
hands, and must, if we may judge by his dislike of
them, have rendered his life a burden.</p>

<p>This, however, is a single example, and insufficient
to deter others from the attempt. It may be that
this individual had not entered fully into the spirit
of Andalucian existence. Every detail of life being
here adapted to the place and its customs and
climate, no custom can be erred against with impunity&mdash;that
is, without the forfeit of some corresponding
advantage.</p>

<p>Seville presents two so different aspects during the
two opposite seasons of the year, that to be well
understood it should be visited at both. During the
winter, the existence does not materially differ from
that of the inhabitants of most other European
towns; excepting that the intercourse of society is
subjected to less formality. Cards of invitation are<a name="page_402" id="page_402"></a>
rarely made use of; and you are not, consequently,
exposed to the annoyance of seeing and hearing your
house invaded by a dense crowd, on a night you have
appointed a month before, without any possibility of
foreseeing whether you would be disposed or not on
that particular night to undergo such a toil.
These crowds are, I believe, unheard of in Seville;
but those who are pleased in each other's society,
know where to find each other; and without waiting
for invitations, small circles are formed every evening,
from which all crushing, fatigue, and intense
dressing are excluded.</p>

<p>The winter is also a more advantageous season for
the stranger, who would be totally debarred by the
summer heats from the activity necessary for the
satisfaction of his curiosity, in visiting the objects of
interest contained in and around Seville. On the
other hand, the summer season offers to his contemplation
the successful attainment of a mode of existence
suited to the burning climate; a problem
found to be solved but in few instances. The first
and most essential arrangement appears to be the
turning night into day, and <i>vice versâ</i>, as far as
regards society and all locomotion. No one leaves
his house until long after sunset, and visiting commences
some hours later. The morning being consequently
the time for repose, and the breakfast hour<a name="page_403" id="page_403"></a>
nevertheless remaining the same all the year round,
the <i>siesta</i> is very essential, and is judiciously placed
between the dinner, which terminates at four, and
the hour for movement&mdash;nine, when the Sevillano,
refreshed by three or four hours sleep, and a fresh
toilette, is infinitely better disposed for the evening's
amusements than the denizen of more northern
climes, who rises at that or a later hour from the
chief repast of the day, and is put <i>en train</i> by the less
natural and less durable stimulants of the table.</p>

<p>This mode of life presents other numerous advantages.
A very prominent one is the inviolable
division of time between society and solitude. We
suppose the hour for rising eight,&mdash;immediately after
the chocolate,&mdash;that of breakfast eleven. The intervening
hours are solitary, and are frequently divided
between the pillow and the toilette; while they
are sometimes devoted to more useful occupations,
and added to by earlier risers. From the family
meeting at breakfast until the dinner hour, three,
the time may be employed in business, reading,
in fact, in every one's habitual pursuits. No intrusion
is to be feared. No accursed idler lounges in to
interrupt with his compliments, or gossip, your letter
to your lawyer, or, if you are a lawyer yourself, that
to your client; nor is the conscience of scrupulous
porters burdened with the mendacious "not at home."<a name="page_404" id="page_404"></a></p>

<p>These hours are sacred, and guaranteed by the
very air, which renders the streets impassable, but
leaves the cool court protected from the sun's ray
by the <i>toldo</i>, (canvas awning spread at a level with
the roof, and which is reefed up at night like a sail,)
and refreshed by its ever-murmuring fountain and
cool marble pavement, to the peaceable enjoyment of
its owners. The female portion of the family are
thus enabled to devote themselves to household
occupations, or to their favourite employments, without
having to undergo, until the second getting
up in the evening, the fever of a complete toilette,
which would, during the day, be insupportable.
The time thus devoted to society, is amply sufficient;
as it may be prolonged, as each party feels inclined,
from an hour or two after sunset, until the
returning rays drive all back to their cool retreat.</p>

<p>The night of the festival of St. John is, in Seville,
sacred, from remote time, to amusement and festivity.
During the five or six hours of darkness
accorded by the Midsummer sun, the banks of the
Guadalquivir echo the gay melodious laugh, which
enlivens the animated buzz of the crowd; and the
morning ray gilds the upper windows of the
deserted houses before their doors are opened to the
supper-craving population. The rite practised on
this occasion is marked by a simplicity altogether<a name="page_405" id="page_405"></a>
antique. The youth of Seville, that is the masculine
portion, have provided themselves with small
boxes, containing a sort of sugar-plum of exquisite
flavour. One of these is held between the finger
and thumb of the <i>cavallero</i>, from the moment he sets
foot on the promenade. On the approach of a party
of ladies he endeavours to distinguish, as far off as
the gloom permits, the features or dress of an already
selected object of preference; or, if still free to
make a selection, some countenance possessed of
sufficient attraction to determine his choice. On
discovering the owner of either of these requisites, he
watches a favourable opportunity, and approaching
the lady, offers the bonbon.</p>

<p>The <i>señorita</i>&mdash;of course unmarried&mdash;thus selected,
is obliged to accept the compliment if properly
offered, as well as the arm of the <i>cavallero</i> during
the rest of the night; and, on arriving at her house,
he receives from her parents, or chaperon, as the
case may be, an invitation to supper. Should the
lady be desirous of avoiding the compliment, of
the approach of which she is usually aware, she
must exercise her ingenuity in putting obstacles
in the way of the attempt. In this effort many are
successful, since the peculiar mode of proceeding,
obligatory on those who make the offer, affords
certain facilities. The condition is not binding on<a name="page_406" id="page_406"></a>
the fair object of the compliment, unless the lips
receive the bonbon immediately from the finger
and thumb of the cavalier. This is a source of
no small amusement to the <i>señoritas</i> at the expense
of strangers from other provinces of Spain. Conscious
of being the object of preference of some
young beginner, or stranger uninitiated in the
mysteries of the rite&mdash;and who, let it be understood,
does not happen to be an object of preference with
them&mdash;they will afford him every facility of approach,
and on receiving the present in the hand, will
repulse without mercy the luckless wight, whose
retiring steps are accompanied by peals of laughter
from all the party.</p>

<p>The month of June is likewise distinguished by
the procession of the Corpus Christi. On this
occasion all the principal streets are protected from
the sun by canvas awnings; and from the windows
of every house draperies are suspended, the materials
of which are more or less rich according to the
means of their respective proprietors. From an
early hour of the morning, ushered in by sunshine
and the gay orchestra of the Giralda bells, the vast
marble pavement of the cathedral begins to disappear
beneath the momentarily increasing crowd.
Here all classes are mingled; but the most conspicuous
are the arrivals from the surrounding<a name="page_407" id="page_407"></a>
villages, distinguished by their more sunburnt complexions
and the showy colours of their costume,
contrasted with the uniformly dark tints of the
attire of the Sevillanos.</p>

<p>Here are seen also in great numbers, accompanied
by their relatives, the gay <i>cigarreras</i>, whose acquaintance
we shall presently make in the <i>fabrica de tabaco</i>.
The instinctive coquetry discernible, no less in the
studied reserve of their looks than in the smart step
and faultless nicety of costume, indicates how easy
would be the transition to the quality of the still
more <i>piquant</i> but somewhat less moral <i>maja</i>. The
black satin, low-quartered shoe is of a different
material; but the snow-white stocking, and dark
green skirt the same&mdash;and the black-velvet bordered
mantilla is the identical one, which was held
tight to the chin, when passing, the evening before,
under the city walls on the return from the manufactory
to the faubourg at the other extremity of
Seville.</p>

<p>The procession, headed by a band of music, and
accompanied by the dignitaries of the diocese, and
civil authorities of the province, bearing <i>cierges</i>,
winds through the principal streets, and re-enters
the church to the sound of the two magnificent
organs, never heard in unison except on this anniversary.
The exterior of the principal portal is<a name="page_408" id="page_408"></a>
ornamented on this occasion with a sort of curtain,
which is said to contain upwards of three thousand
yards of crimson velvet, bordered with gold lace.
The columns of the centre nave are also completely
attired from top to bottom with coverings of the
same material. The value of the velvet employed,
is stated at nearly ten thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Christmas-day is also solemnized at Seville, with
much zeal; but the manner of doing it honour presents
more of novelty than splendour. At the early
hour of seven the parish churches are completely
filled. The organ pours forth, from that time until
the termination of the service, an uninterrupted succession
of airs, called <i>seguidillas</i>, from the dance to
which they are adapted. On the gallery, which adjoins
the organ-loft of each church, are established
five or six muscular youths, selected for their untiring
activity. They are provided each with a tambourine,
and their duty consists in drawing from
it as much, and as varied sound as it will render
without coming to pieces. With this view they
enter upon the amiable contest, and try, during
three or four hours, which of their number, employing
hands, knees, feet, and elbows in succession,
can produce the most racking intonations. On the
pavement immediately below, there is generally
a group, composed of the friends of the performers,<a name="page_409" id="page_409"></a>
as may be discerned from the smiles of intelligence
directed upwards and downwards. Some of
these appear, from the animated signs of approbation
and encouragement, with which they reward
each more than usually violent concussion, to be
backers of favourite heroes. During all this time
one or two priests are engaged before the altar in
the performance of a series of noiseless ceremonies;
and the pavement of the body of the church is pressed
by the knees of a dense crowd of devotees.</p>

<p>The propensity to robbery and assassination, attributed
by several tourists to the population of
this country, has been much exaggerated. The imagination
of the stranger is usually so worked upon
by these accounts, as to induce him never to set
foot outside the walls of whatever city he inhabits,
without being well armed. As far as regards the
environs of Seville, this precaution is superfluous.
They may be traversed in all directions, at all events
within walking distance, or to the extent of a moderate
ride, without risk. Far from exercising violence,
the peasants never fail, in passing, to greet the
stranger with a respectful salutation. But I cannot
be guarantee for other towns or environs which
I have not visited. It is certain that equal security
does not exist nearer the coast, on the frequented
roads which communicate between San Lucar, Xeres,<a name="page_410" id="page_410"></a>
and Cadiz; nor in the opposite direction, throughout
the mountain passes of the Sierra Morena. But
this state of things is far from being universal.</p>

<p>I would much prefer passing a night on a country
road in the neighbourhood of Seville, to threading
the maze of streets, which form the south-eastern
portion of the town, mentioned above as containing
the greater number of the residences of
private families. This quarter is not without its
perils. In fact, if dark deeds are practised, no situation
could possibly be better suited to them. These
Arab streets wind, and twist, and turn back on
themselves like a serpent in pain. Every ten yards
presents a hiding-place. There is just sufficient
lighting up at night to prevent your distinguishing
whether the street is clear or not: and the
ground-floors of the houses, in the winter season,
are universally deserted.</p>

<p>An effectual warning was afforded me, almost immediately
on my arrival at Seville, against frequenting
this portion of the town without precaution after
nightfall. An acquaintance, a young Sevillano, who
had been my daily companion during the first five or
six days which followed my arrival, was in the habit
of frequenting with assiduity, some of the above-mentioned
streets. He inhabited one of them, and
was continually drawn by potent attraction towards<a name="page_411" id="page_411"></a>
two others. In one, in particular, he followed a
practice, the imprudence of which, in more than one
respect, as he was much my junior, I had already
pointed out to him. A lady, as you have already
conjectured, resided in the house, in question. My
friend, like many of his compatriots, "sighed to
many;" but he loved this one; and she was precisely
the one that "could ne'er be his." She allowed
him, however, a harmless rendezvous, separated from
all danger, as she thought, by the distance from the
ground to the balcony, situated on the first-floor.
The lady being married, and regular visiting being
only possible at formal intervals, these interviews
had by degrees alarmingly, as appeared to me, increased
in frequency and duration; until at length
during two hours each evening, my acquaintance
poured forth in a subdued tone, calculated to reach
only the fair form which bent over the balcony, his
tender complaints.</p>

<p>The youth of these climes are communicative on
subjects which so deeply interest their feelings; and
whether willing or not, one is often admitted to share
their secrets at the commencement of an acquaintance.
It was thus that I had had an opportunity of
lecturing my friend on the various dangers attending
the practice in which he was persisting, and of
recommending him&mdash;the best advice of all being,<a name="page_412" id="page_412"></a>
of course, useless&mdash;to revive the more prudent
custom of by-gone times, and if he must offer
nightly incense to the object of his fire, to adopt the
mode sanctioned by Count Almaviva, and entrust
his vows to the mercenary eloquence of choristers
and catgut&mdash;to anything&mdash;or anybody, provided it
be done by proxy. My warning was vain; but the
mischief did not befall him exactly in the manner
I had contemplated.</p>

<p>His cousin opened my door while I was breakfasting,
and informed me that L&mdash;&mdash; was in the house of
Don G&mdash;&mdash; A&mdash;&mdash;, and in bed, having received a
wound the previous night from some robbers; and
that he wished to see me. I found him in a house,
into which I had already been introduced, being one
of those he most frequented. A bed had been prepared
in the drawing-room, all the window-shutters
of which were closed, and he was lying there, surrounded
by the family of his host, to whom was
added his sister. As he was unable to speak above a
whisper, I was given the seat by the bedside, while
he related to me his adventure.</p>

<p>He had just quitted the street of the balcony at
about nine o'clock, and was approaching the house
we were now in, when, on turning a corner, he was
attacked by three ruffians, one of whom demanded
his money in the usual terms, "Your purse, or your<a name="page_413" id="page_413"></a>
life!" while, before he had time to reply, but was
endeavouring to pass on, a second faced him, and
stabbed him in the breast through his cloak. He
then ran forward, followed by the three, down the
street, into the house, and up the staircase; the
robbers not quitting the pursuit until he rang the
bell on the first-floor. The surgeon had been immediately
called, and had pronounced him wounded
within&mdash;not an inch, but the tenth part of an inch&mdash;of
his life; for the steel had penetrated to within
that distance of his heart.</p>

<p>My first impression was that the robbers were
acting a part, and had been hired to get rid of him,&mdash;otherwise
what were the utility of stabbing him,
when they might have rifled his pockets without
such necessity? But this he assured me could not
be the case, as the person most likely to fall under
such suspicion, was incapable of employing similar
means; adding, that that was the usual mode of
committing robberies in Seville. I left him, after
having assured him how much I envied his good
fortune; seeing that he was in no danger, and only
condemned to pass a week or two in the society of
charming women, all zealously employed in nursing
him&mdash;for such was the truth&mdash;one of the young ladies
being supposed, and I fear with justice, to be the
object of his addresses.<a name="page_414" id="page_414"></a></p>

<p>The ungrateful wretch convinced me by his reply
(as we conversed in French, and were not understood
by those present) that his greatest torment was impatience
to escape from his confinement, in order to
see or write to the other fair one.</p>

<p>At the end of a week he was sufficiently recovered
to be removed to the house of his family. From
certain hints, dropped during a conversation which
took place more than a month after the event, it is
to be feared that the knife of the assassin, in approaching
so near to the heart of his intended
victim, succeeded, by some mysterious electric transmission,
in inflicting a positive wound on that of
the lady of the balcony.</p>

<p>I afterwards learned that it was usual for those
who inhabited or frequented this part of Seville,
and indeed all other parts, excepting the few principal
thoroughfares and streets containing the
shops and cafés, to carry arms after nightfall; and
in shaking hands with an acquaintance, I have
sometimes perceived a naked sword-blade half
visible among the folds of his cloak. These perils
only exist in the winter, and not in all winters;
only in those during which provisions increase in
price beyond the average, and the season is more
than usually rigorous: the poor being thus exposed
to more than the accustomed privations.<a name="page_415" id="page_415"></a></p>

<p>There are towns in which assassination and robbery
are marked by more audacity than is their
habitual character in this part of Andalucia. Of
these, Malaga is said to be one of the worst,
although perhaps the most favoured spot in Europe,
with respect to natural advantages. An instance of
daring ruffianism occurred there this winter. A
person of consideration in the town had been found
in the street stabbed and robbed. His friends,
being possessed of much influence, and disposing,
no doubt, of other weighty inducements to action,
the police was aroused to unusual activity; the
murderer was arrested, and brought before the
Alcalde primero. A summary mode of jurisprudence
was put in practice, and the culprit was ordered for
execution on the following day. On being led from
the presence of the court, he turned to the Alcalde,
and addressing him with vehemence, threatened
him with certain death, in the event of the sentence
being put in execution. The Alcalde, although
doubtless not entirely free from anxiety, was, by
the threat itself, the more forcibly bound to carry
into effect the judgment he had pronounced. The
execution, therefore, took place at the appointed
hour. The following morning, the dead body of
the Alcalde was found in a street adjoining that
in which he resided.<a name="page_416" id="page_416"></a></p>

<h5>INQUISITION. COLLEGE OF SAN TELMO. CIGAR MANUFACTORY.
BULL CIRCUS. EXCHANGE. AYUNTAMIENTO.</h5>

<p class="r">Seville.<br />
</p>

<p>In the faubourg of Triana, separated from the
town by the river, may be distinguished remains
of the ancient castle, which became the headquarters
of the Inquisition, on its first creation,
in 1482. That body was, however, shortly afterwards,
compelled to evacuate the building, by a
great inundation of the Guadalquivir, which occurred
in the year 1626. It then moved into the
town, and, from that period to the close of its functions,
occupied an edifice situated in the parish
of Saint Mark. Its jurisdiction did not extend
beyond Andalucia. The entire body was composed
of the following official persons:&mdash;three inquisitors,
a judge of the fisc, a chief Alguazil, a receiver, (of
fines,) five secretaries, ten counsellors, eighty qualifiers,
one advocate of the fisc, one alcayde of the
prison, one messenger, ten honest persons, two <a name="page_417" id="page_417"></a>surgeons,
and one porter. For the City of Seville, one
hundred familiars: for the entire district, the commissaries,
notaries, and familiars, amounted to four
thousand. The ten honest persons cut but a sorry
figure in so long a list. Do they not tempt you to
parody Prince Hal's exclamation "Monstrous! but
one halfpenny-worth of bread to this intolerable
deal of sack?"</p>

<p>The Inquisition of Seville is of an earlier date
than that of Toledo, and was the first established in
Spain. It was likewise the most distinguished by
the rigour of its sentences. The actual horrors of
the inquisitorial vaults were, I imagine, in general
much exaggerated. A few instances of severity,
accompanied by a mystery, skilfully designed to
magnify its effect, was sufficient to set on fire the
inflammable imaginations of these sunny regions,
and to spread universal terror. It was on finding
these means insufficient for the extirpation of
religious dissent, that, at length, executions were
decreed by wholesale. Rather than give credit to
the voluminous list of the secret cruelties, which
were supposed by many to be exercised by the midnight
tribunals, and which could have no adequate
object, since a conversion brought about by such
means could not, when known, profit the cause. I
think it probable that all acts of severity were made<a name="page_418" id="page_418"></a>
as public as possible, in order to employ the terror
they inspired as a means of swelling the ranks of
Catholicism.</p>

<p>My opinion is in some measure backed by what
occurred at Toledo. On the Inquisition of that
city being dislodged from its palace,&mdash;now the seat
of the provincial administration,&mdash;it was expected
that the exploration of the subterraneous range of
apartments, known to be extensive, would bring to
light a whole Apocalypse of horrors; and all who
had interest enough to obtain admission, pressed in
crowds to be present at the opening. The disappointment
was immense on finding not a single
piece of iron, not the shadow of a skeleton, not a square
inch of bloodstain. Each individual, however, during
the permanence of these tribunals, lived in awe of
their power; and the daily actions of thousands were
influenced by the fear of becoming the victims of
their cruelties, whether real or imaginary.</p>

<p>The terror which surrounded the persons of their
agents invested them with a moral power, which
frequently rendered them careless of the precaution
of physical force in cases where it would have appeared
to be a necessary instrument in the execution
of their designs. This confidence was once well-nigh
fatal to two zealous defenders of the faith. The
Archbishop of Toledo, subsequently Cardinal<a name="page_419" id="page_419"></a>
Ximenes de Cisneros being on a visit at the residence
of his brother of the see of Granada, it
occurred to them during an after-dinner conversation
that, could they accomplish the immediate conversion
of the few thousands of Moors remaining in
Granada, it would be the means of rendering a signal
service to the Catholic Roman Apostolic religion.</p>

<p>Inflamed with a sudden ardour, and rendered
doubly fearless of results by the excellence of the
archiepiscopal repast, they resolved that the project
should be put in execution that very evening.</p>

<p>Ever since the Conquest of Granada, a portion
of the city had been appropriated to the Moors who
thought proper to remain; and who received on
that occasion the solemn assurance that no molestation
would be offered to their persons or property,
nor impediment thrown in the way of their worship.
Their part of the town was called the Albaycin, and
was separated from the rest by a valley. It contained
some twenty to thirty thousand peaceably
disposed inhabitants.</p>

<p>The two enterprising archbishops, their plan
being matured (although insufficiently, as will appear)
repaired to a house bordering on the Moorish
quarter; and, calling together all the Familiars of
the Inquisition who could be met with on the spur
of the occasion, divided them into parties, each of a<a name="page_420" id="page_420"></a>
certain force, and dispatched them on their errand,
which was, to enter the houses of the infidels, and to
intimate to the principal families the behest of the
prelates, requiring them by break of day, to abjure
the errors of their creed, and to undergo the ceremony
of baptism.</p>

<p>But in order that so meritorious a work should
meet with the least possible delay, all the children
under a certain age were to be conveyed instantaneously
to the house occupied by the Archbishops,
in order that they might be baptised at once.</p>

<p>The agents opened the campaign, and had already
made away with a certain number of terrified infants,
whose souls were destined to be saved thus
unceremoniously, when the alarm began to spread;
and, at the moment when the two dignitaries, impatient
to commence operations, were inquiring for the
first batch of unfledged heretics, an unexpected confusion
of sounds was heard to proceed simultaneously
from all sides of the house, and to increase rapidly
in clearness and energy: and some of the attendants,
entering, with alarm depicted on their countenances,
announced that a few hundred armed
Moors had surrounded the house, and were searching
for an entrance.</p>

<p>It now, for the first time, occurred to the confederates,
that difficulties might possibly attend the execution<a name="page_421" id="page_421"></a>
of their project; and their ardour having had
nearly time to cool, Archbishop Ximenes, a personage
by no means wanting in prudence and energy, during
his moments of reason, employed the first instants
of the siege in taking what precautions the circumstances
admitted. He next proceeded to indite a
hasty line, destined for the sovereigns Ferdinand
and Isabella, who were journeying in the province,
to inform them of his situation, and request immediate
assistance. A black slave was selected to
be the bearer of the letter: but, thinking to inspire
him with greater promptitude and zeal, an attendant
thrust into his hand a purse of money together with
the document.</p>

<p>The effect of this was the opposite to that which
was intended. The negro treated himself at every
house of entertainment on his road; until, before
he had half accomplished his journey, he was totally
incapacitated for further progress. This circumstance
could not, however, influence the fate of
the besieged prelates; who would have had time
to give complete satisfaction to the offended Moors
before the King could receive the intelligence. Fortunately
for them, the news had reached the governor
of Granada, a general officer in whose religious
zeal they had not had sufficient confidence
to induce them to apply to him for aid in the emergency.<a name="page_422" id="page_422"></a>
That officer, on hearing the state of things,
sent for a body of troops stationed at a neighbouring
village, to whose commander he gave orders
to place a guard, for the protection at the same time
of the churchmen from violent treatment, and of
the Moors from every sort of molestation. This
adventure of the Archbishop drew upon him the
temporary displeasure of the Court.</p>

<span class="caption">PORTAL OF SAN TELMO, SEVILLE.</span>
</div>

<p>The public buildings of Seville are on as grand
a scale as those of some of the principal capitals
of Europe. The college of San Telmo, fronting
the Christina-gardens, is composed of two large
quadrangles, behind a façade of five or six hundred
feet in length, the centre of which is ornamented
by a portal of very elaborate execution in the <i>plateresco</i>
style. The architect, Matias de Figueroa, has
literally crammed the three stories with carved
columns, inscriptions, balconies, statues single and
grouped, arches, medallions, wreaths, friezes. Without
subjecting it to criticism on the score of purity,
to which it makes no pretension, it certainly is
rich in its general effect, and one of the best specimens
of its style. This college was founded for
the instruction of marine cadets, and for that reason
named after S. Telmo, who is adopted by the
mariners for their patron and advocate, as Santa
Barbara is by the land artillery. He was a Dominican<a name="page_423" id="page_423"></a>
friar, and is recorded to have exercised
miraculous influence on the elements, and thereby
to have preserved the lives of a boatful of sailors,
when on the point of destruction. The gardens
in front of this building are situated between the
river and the town walls. They are laid out in
flower beds and walks. In the centre is a raised<a name="page_424" id="page_424"></a>
platform of granite, forming a long square of
about an acre or more in extent, surrounded with
a seat of white marble. It is entered at each end
by an ascent of two or three steps. This is called
the Salon, and on Sundays and Feast-days is the
resort of the society of Seville. In the winter the
hour of the promenade is from one to three o'clock;
in the summer, the hours which intervene between
sunset and supper. During winter as well as summer,
the scent of the flowers of the surrounding
gardens fills the Salon, than which it is difficult
to imagine a more charming promenade.</p>

<p>The cigar manufactory is also situated outside
the walls. It is a modern edifice of enormous dimensions,
and not inelegant. In one of the rooms
between two and three hundred <i>cigareras</i>, girls
employed in rolling cigars, are seen at work, and
heard likewise; for, such a Babel of voices never
met mortal ear, although familiar with the music
of the best furnished rookeries. The leaden roof,
which covers the whole establishment, furnishes a
promenade of several acres.</p>

<p>I am anxious to return to the interior of Seville,
in order to introduce you to the Lonja; but we
must not omit the Plaza de los Toros, (bull circus,)
situated likewise outside the walls, and in view
of the river. It is said to be the handsomest in<a name="page_425" id="page_425"></a>
Spain, as well as the largest. In fact it ought to
be the best, as belonging to the principal city of
the especial province of <i>toreadores</i>. It is approached
by the gate nearest to the cathedral, and which
deserves notice, being the handsomest gate of Seville.
The principal entrance to the Plaza is on
the opposite side from the town, where the building
presents a large portion of a circle, ornamented
with plain arches round the upper story. This upper
portion extends only round a third part of the circus,
which is the extent of the part completed with
boxes and galleries, containing the higher class seats.
All the remainder consists of an uniform series of
retreating rows of seats, in the manner of an amphitheatre,
sufficient for the accommodation of an immense
multitude. These rows of seats are continued
round the whole circus: but those beneath the upper
building are not accessible to the same class of spectators
as the others&mdash;the price of the place being different.
This is regulated by the position with regard
to the sun, the shaded seats being the dearest.
The upper story consists of an elegant gallery, ornamented
with a colonnade, in the centre of which the
box of the president is surmounted by a handsomely
decorated arch.</p>

<p>The circus, measured from the outside, is about
two hundred and fifty feet in diameter. Those who<a name="page_426" id="page_426"></a>
are desirous of witnessing to what lengths human
enthusiasm may be carried, should see a representation
in this Plaza. With seven prime bulls from
La Ronda, and a quadrille of Seville <i>toreros</i>&mdash;the
enormous circumference as full as it can hold, (as it
always is,) it is one of the most curious sights that
can be met with.</p>

<p>The origin of this amusement is not easy to be
ascertained. It was undoubtedly in vogue among
the Spanish Arabs, and probably originated in the
time of the Goths, on the falling off of the representations
of the Roman amphitheatres for want of
a sufficient supply of wild beasts. In times not very
remote, it had become principally an amateur performance,
and the <i>toreros</i> were men of rank, who
made choice of this arena, subsequently to the falling
into disuse of the lists, in order to exhibit their
daring and dexterity before the objects of their flame.
The science is still studied by the greater part of
the Spanish youth; just as, in England, the custom
is maintained of receiving instruction in pugilism;
but an amateur is rarely seen in these days to figure
in a public arena.</p>

<p>The intense interest which absorbs the feelings of
those present at these representations, affords a faint
notion of what must have been the attractions of a
Roman circus, in which combats were sustained by<a name="page_427" id="page_427"></a>
hundreds of wild beasts. In the bull-fight&mdash;sustained
by a single animal, the interest would not
probably be excited by the mere contest for life
which takes place between the man and the brute,
and of which the ultimate result is foreseen. It
would, on the contrary, often yield to the disgust
produced by the needless massacre of the horses;
were it not that the graceful performance of the
<i>toreros</i>, and their elegant costume, so well calculated
to set off the symmetry of their form, first draws the
attention, which, once fixed, is gradually absorbed by
the progress of the contest, and at length irresistibly
won by the variety of unforeseen incidents which
follow in rapid succession.</p>

<p>Frequenters of theatres have been seen to fall
asleep during the most stirring scene of a melodrame;
and a continual murmur of conversation
usually forms a running accompaniment to the voices
of opera singers; but no one was ever detected slumbering
in a <i>plaza de toros</i>; nor is a remark uttered
that does not relate to the performance. This difference
may probably be explained by the superior
attraction of the <i>imprévu</i>. In the playhouse not
only is the event known beforehand, but also every
incident by which it is preceded; whereas, throughout
a <i>corrida de toros</i> nothing can be foreseen. No
one knows, during the present minute, whether the<a name="page_428" id="page_428"></a>
next will give birth to the direst of tragedies, or to
the most exhilarating farce.</p>

<p>At Madrid the representations are inferior to those
at Seville. They are able, it is true, to procure as
fierce bulls; but they are brought from a considerable
distance, and are much more expensive. The
principal inferiority consists in the men, who at
Madrid are wanting in the rapidity of eye, and
careless courage of the Andaluz. On the entrance
of a bull on the arena, whose attitude gives promise
of an animated course, almost all the Madrid
<i>toreros</i>, (I have seen all,) will, at his first onset, disappear
simultaneously over the <i>barrera</i>. The <i>barrera</i>
is the enclosure of stout planks, strengthened by
posts, which separates the performers from the spectators.
It is about six feet in height. At a height
of three feet a projecting ledge runs round the
whole, upon which, in vaulting over, the <i>toreador</i>
places his foot. Behind this enclosure an open space
of four feet in width is left, and serves as a refuge
for those who are hard pressed. Very different is
the graceful and careless attitude with which the
Andaluz awaits the approach of the infuriated brute,
and quietly springs aside with a flourish of his
mantle of silk, while he knows there are others at
hand to draw off the animal's attention.</p>

<p>With the exception of the <i>Toros</i> the public amusements<a name="page_429" id="page_429"></a>
of Seville are limited to the balls at the Lonja
during the Carnival, and to the opera. The opera
varies its own pleasures, while it distributes its
favours between the two western capitals of the province.
From midsummer to midwinter Cadiz receives
her share of melody, and the remaining six
months are bestowed on Seville. Xeres has, I believe,
a company to itself, supplied by a different
<i>impresario</i>.</p>

<p>The Rossi is an excellent <i>primera dama</i>, although
wanting in animation; and Comfortini is by no
means a bad tenor. The second tenor, Tosi, is said
to be ambitious of displaying his somewhat exaggerated
attitudes on the boards of the Haymarket.
There is a deficiency of <i>ensemble</i>, since the severe
discipline necessary for obtaining that result does
not accord with the genius of the place&mdash;or perhaps
an unexceptionable <i>maestro de capella</i> is too expensive
a luxury to suit the Seville purses. However
this may be, the easy inhabitants, who hear the same
opera frequently six times in a week, and would
hear it seven times had not the performers a holiday
on Saturday&mdash;may be taken grievous liberties with
before they utter a complaint. They, in fact, look
upon the performance chiefly as an excuse for resorting
to this their habitual lounge.</p>

<p>The Barbiere di Seviglia should, however, be witnessed<a name="page_430" id="page_430"></a>
here by every amateur. It is only here that
justice is done to the <i>libretto</i> of Rossini's masterpiece.
Figaro becomes a real barber, and scorns all
velvets and finery; and Almaviva leaves his court-dress
at home, and takes a good <i>capa</i> of <i>paño pardo</i>
for his nocturnal excursions. The scenery represents
the actual streets of Seville. Local customs
are introduced, and local expressions interspersed in
the Italian dialogue. On this occasion one spirit
animates boxes, lunetas, orchestra, and stage. At
the opening note of the first melody the allegro,
passing like electricity from the corner of the page
through the eye, brain, and arm of the leader, appears
as though it spirted like wildfire from the
extremity of his bow over stage, boxes, stalls, and
galleries, lighting up in an instant all eyes with
animation and pleasure.</p>

<p>In the scene of old Bartolo's discomfiture the
melodies of the <i>maestro</i> are totally extinguished beneath
the din of overturned tables and chairs, and
cracking furniture; and the joyous exclamations of
the entire assembly, unite with the jibes of the actors,
and seem to pursue the poor old guardian with one
overwhelming peal of derision.</p>

<p>But it is only in this one instance that representations
come off in such a manner. On the contrary,
the company exhibit habitually all the aristocratic<a name="page_431" id="page_431"></a>
<i>nonchalance</i> of larger capitals. Their business there
is society. It is there that <i>les affaires de c&#339;ur</i> hold
their Royal Exchange; and observation, conjecture,
and speculation,&mdash;but usually without ill-nature,&mdash;sufficiently
occupy those who are not actors in this
general by-play. The youth of these climes do not
put in practice the same arts of concealment and
reserve as are adopted in colder cities; but each,
unconscious of evil, makes for the box of his <i>enamorata</i>;
or, if that is impossible, for the nearest vacant
situation. Advise, therefore, any friend who may
intend visiting Seville, not hastily to pay his visit of
curiosity to the opera, but to wait, if possible, until
offered a seat by some <i>habituée</i> in her box. This
<i>Senora</i> may possibly not have any <i>affaire</i> of her own
on hand; in fact the married ladies of course form
an exception, if not in all cases, at least as far as
regards such undisguised manifestations of preference:&mdash;in
this case she will take delight in putting
him <i>au fait</i> of all those that are going forward.</p>

<p>If in a conversable humour she will do more.
Commencing with the nearest, or the most conspicuous
of the performers in these mute dramas, she
will relate to him the vicissitudes of the respective
histories up to the time then present, and the probabilities
which each case may suggest for the future.
Thus your friend, instead of having sacrificed an<a name="page_432" id="page_432"></a>
entire evening to the dubious amusement of following
the plot of a single opera, which may have been
a bad one, or interpreted by bad actors, will return
to rest with some score of plots and romances filling
all the corners of his memory&mdash;all possessing the
zest of reality and actuality, as he will have contemplated
the heroes and heroines in their mortal shape,
and clothed in indisputable <i>capas</i> and <i>mantillas</i>; besides,
another advantage which these romances will
possess over all the popular and standard novels&mdash;that
of omitting the most insipid chapter of all, the
one containing the <i>dénouement</i>.</p>

<p>There only remain two public buildings worthy of
notice; but they are such as to rank among the most
remarkable of Spain. The Lonja (Exchange) was
erected during the reign of Philip the Second, in the
year 1583, by Juan de Herrera. At this period the
excesses committed in all parts of Spain by the
architects, no longer restrained by rule of any sort,
had brought about a salutary effect, after a sufficiently
lengthened surfeit of extravagance. Herrera
took the lead in the reaction, and followed the more
correct models of art.</p>

<p>Among the authors of some of the most lamentable
specimens of aberration of style scattered throughout
Spain, are found several names high in rank among
the painters of the best period. These artists, desirous<a name="page_433" id="page_433"></a>
of emulating some of the great masters of
Italy, who had attained equal superiority in architecture,
painting, and sculpture, risked their reputation
in these different pursuits with greater confidence
than just appreciation of their peculiar
genius. At the head of them was Alonzo Cano, one
of the most distinguished painters of the schools of
Andalucia; and who has been called the Guido of
Spain. He may certainly lay a more legitimate claim
to that title than to that of the Michael Angelo of
Spain, accorded to him by some of the less judicious
of his admirers for no other reason than that of his
combining the three above mentioned arts.</p>

<p>His paintings are characterized by a peculiar
delicacy of manner, correct drawing, and exquisite
finish. The sickly paleness of his flesh is sometimes
unpleasing, and his personages are gainers by the
addition of drapery, in the arrangement of which
he approaches to the excellence of the best Italian
schools. The life of this artist was varied by more
adventure than usually falls to the lot of those of his
profession. His talent as a painter had already
become celebrated while he was still a monk, having
taken the vows very early in life. He had been
from the first an enemy to the subordination of the
cloister, and at length a series of irregularities led to
his expulsion from his monastery.<a name="page_434" id="page_434"></a></p>

<p>Alonzo was not, however, the original inventor of
this eccentric style. A Roman architect, Francisco
Borromini, the rival of Bernini, and of whom it was
said, that he was the first of his time in elevation of
genius, and the last in the employment of it,&mdash;is
supposed to have first introduced it. Followers and
imitators of these sprung up in great numbers, and
Spain was speedily inundated with extravagancies:
façades, moulded into more sinuosities than a labyrinth,&mdash;cornices,
multiplying their angles like a saw,
murderously amputated columns, and broken-backed
pediments. Juan de Herrera was not, probably,
possessed of more talent than the Roman; but of
what he had he made a better use. His reputation
was beginning to make rapid progress when he was
selected, on the death of Juan Baptista de Toledo, to
continue the Escorial. His task there was not the
simple one of continuing the unfinished pile according
to the plans already traced.</p>

<p>The religious fervor of Philip the Second was on
the ascent, and during the progress of the building
he had resolved to double the number of monks, for
whom accommodation had been provided by the
original plan. To meet this necessity, Herrera
raised the buildings to double their intended elevation.
His completion of this immense work,
rendered more difficult than it would have been
had the original design been his own, or even had<a name="page_435" id="page_435"></a>
that of his predecessor been persisted in (for various
other modifications were commanded, especially with
regard to the plan of the church,) fully established
his fame; and the edifice would probably have
gained, had Philip not, at the last moment, yielded
to a new caprice, and called in another artist (the
architect of the famous country-house of the Viso) to
erect the great staircase.</p>

<p>The object of Herrera, traceable in all his works,
was the re-establishment of antique art in all its
purity. In cathedrals success was more difficult of
attainment than in civil edifices; but the effort is
easily discerned, striving against the difficulties inseparable
from the system, which applies to the purposes
of one creed the principles of art invented for
ministering to other forms. His cathedral of Valladolid
is an instance of this: the most unsuccessful portion
of which (the tower) has fallen before the completion
of the edifice. Should the works ever be
continued, this would be a most fortunate circumstance,
were it not that the future builders are sure
to persist in the same course, and to disfigure the
pile with another similar excrescence, in contempt
of symmetry and rule.</p>

<p>The Lonja of Seville is a structure so perfect as to
bid defiance to criticism. It might have been built
by Vitruvius. The general plan is a quadrangle, enclosing
a court surrounded by an arcade. There are<a name="page_436" id="page_436"></a>
two stories, ornamented externally by pilasters.
The order is Tuscan, both above and below. The
court, staircase, and various apartments, are decorated
with a profusion of the rarest marbles. The whole
is a specimen, almost unique, of chaste elegance and
massive solidity. In this edifice, the resort of
wealthy traders during the period of the colonial
prosperity of Spain, are contained, among the
archives, the original despatches of Columbus: and,
it is also said, those of Cortez and Pizarro.</p>

<p>The Ayuntamiento, or Town Hall, is an edifice
of another sort. It is of the <i>plateresco</i> epoch. But
Seville, having been apparently preserved by especial
favour from the introduction of specimens of bad
taste; it is a building of extreme beauty. The
façade is divided into two unequal parts. The
smaller of the two is covered with sculpture, and
contains an open porch or vestibule, decorated
throughout with a profusion of ornament. I could
not learn the name of the artist to whom these
sculptures are attributed, but they are worthy of the
chisel of John of Bologna. The other portion of the
front is without ornament from the ground to the
first story, along the whole extent of which runs a series
of open arches supported by columns. These columns
and arches are models of lightness and grace.</p>

<p>The Ayuntamiento is situated in the Plaza de
San Francisco; from one extremity of which a street<a name="page_437" id="page_437"></a>
leads to the cathedral: at the other commences the
principal street of Seville, called the Calle de la
Sierpe. Here are all the best shops, and the principle
cafés. It leads also to the post-office, to the
opera, and to the Plaza del Duque, so called from
its containing the house of the Duke of Medina
Sidonia; but it possesses, likewise, two other ducal
residences, besides others of almost equal pretension.
These mansions are scarcely ever occupied by their
proprietors. It is a small irregularly formed place,
and its ducal habitations, whatever they may be internally,
by no means improve its appearance.</p>

<p>A few streets further on is the Alameda. This is
a place magnificent in extent, but possessing no
architectural merit. Its principal ornament is an
avenue of elms, of about half a mile in length, at the
head of which are placed the two antique columns
and statues of the temple of Hercules. At the
further extremity, on the left, is the church of the
Jesuits, closed since the revolution.</p>
